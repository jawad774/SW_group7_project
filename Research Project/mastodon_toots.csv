Type your email…Subscribe   TL;DR(This is an AI-generated summary of today’s Drop using Ollama + llama 3.2 and a custom prompt.)Plop is a micro-generator framework that streamlines boilerplate code creation using consistent patterns, acting as glue between inquirer prompts and handlebar templates. (https://plopjs.com/)The Lit Starter Kit is a tool for quickly setting up web components using the Lit framework, providing a structured environment for creation, testing, and deployment. (https://github.com/break-stuff/lit-starter-kit)Elia is a terminal-based application that facilitates seamless interaction with large language models directly from the command line, offering a streamlined and engaging user experience. (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) PlopPlop&nbsp;(GH) is a micro-generator framework that streamlines the creation of boilerplate code and files with consistent patterns across projects. It acts as glue code between inquirer prompts and handlebar templates, enabling teams to codify their best practices into easily reproducible templates.The framework operates through a&nbsp;plopfile.js&nbsp;at your project root, which exports a function accepting a&nbsp;plop&nbsp;object. This object provides the API for defining generators that create files and modify code. Each generator consists of prompts (using&nbsp;inquirer.js) and actions that execute based on the prompt responses.Key actions within a plopfile include:add&nbsp;(reates new files using templates)modify&nbsp;(updates existing files using pattern matching or transforms)append&nbsp;(adds content to specific locations in files)addMany&nbsp;(generates multiple files in one operation)You can create dynamic action arrays that adapt based on user input: export default function (plop) {  plop.setGenerator('component', {    prompts: [{      type: 'confirm',      name: 'wantTests',      message: 'Include tests?'    }],    actions: (data) =&gt; {      const actions = [{        type: 'add',        path: 'src/{{name}}.js',        templateFile: 'templates/component.hbs'      }];            if (data.wantTests) {        actions.push({          type: 'add',          path: 'tests/{{name}}.test.js',          templateFile: 'templates/test.hbs'        });      }      return actions;    }  });} The power of Plop lies in its ability to turn “best practices” into the path of least resistance, making it easier for teams to maintain consistency while reducing the cognitive overhead of creating new components, modules, or other repeated patterns in their codebase.Let’s walk through some places you can leverage plop.Creating React/Vue/Angular components with associated files: import { ComponentProps } from ""./types"";import ""./styles.css"";const Component = ({ className="""" }: ComponentProps) =&gt; {  return &lt;div className={className}&gt;{/* content */}&lt;/div&gt;;};export default Component; Ivan Saldano has a&nbsp;full breakdown of this use case, and we’ll see a similar idiom in the middle section.Plop can also&nbsp;generate complete serverless function templates&nbsp;with associated infrastructure code, tests, and configuration files. Don’t worry, though, I won’t be proselytizing Kubernetes or any cloud provider, but I&nbsp;can&nbsp;show a plopfile example for creating systemd unit files for a service/timer pair: export default function (plop) {  plop.setGenerator('systemd-units', {    description: 'Generate systemd service and timer units',    prompts: [{      type: 'input',      name: 'name',      message: 'Service name:'    }, {      type: 'input',      name: 'description',      message: 'Service description:'    }, {      type: 'input',      name: 'execStart',      message: 'Command to execute (ExecStart):'    }, {      type: 'input',      name: 'schedule',      message: 'Timer schedule (OnCalendar, e.g. *-*-* 04:00:00):'    }],    actions: [{      type: 'add',      path: '/etc/systemd/system/{{name}}.service',      template: `[Unit]Description={{description}}After=network-online.targetWants=network-online.target[Service]Type=oneshotExecStart={{execStart}}[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target`    }, {      type: 'add',      path: '/etc/systemd/system/{{name}}.timer',      template: `[Unit]Description=Timer for {{description}}[Timer]OnCalendar={{schedule}}Persistent=true[Install]WantedBy=timers.target`    }]  });} After running this generator, it will create a service unit file that defines the task to be executed, and a timer unit file that controls when the service runsThe generator prompts for essential information and creates standardized unit files following systemd conventions. The generated files will be properly formatted and ready for systemd to use after running&nbsp;systemctl daemon-reload.With plop, you can also, say, manage podcast media episodes by having it create standardized folder structures, generate show notes from templates, and manage sponsor information and tracking links. Amy Dutton has a stellar example of that&nbsp;in this post.Plop’s template-based approach works with any text-based file format, so it’s a handy tool regardless of the primary project language, purpose, or technology stack. Lit Starter KitPhoto by Luke Barky on Pexels.comThe “lit-starter-kit” is a tool designed to help us (OK: me) quickly set up a library of web components using the&nbsp;Lit&nbsp;framework. It provides a structured environment that simplifies the creation, testing, and deployment of Lit-based components. This is super helpful since there is a well-defined structure for Lit’s components (along with quite a bit of required boilerplate), and I need to get better about not one-offing Lit elements.To begin, you can either fork the repository directly or use the following command to create a new project and start developing: $ npm init lit-starter-kit your-project-name The project utilizes “plop” (ref. section uno) to streamline the generation of new components. By running&nbsp;npm run new, you’ll be guided through prompts to set up a new component within your library. Running&nbsp;npm run dev&nbsp;will put the project into development mode (with all the usual goodies).Running&nbsp;npm run build&nbsp;will generate the necessary assets:The dist directory will contain assets for the NPM package.A cdn directory at the project’s root will hold content for Content Delivery Networks.Metadata for your components, including framework integrations like types and React wrappers.For development and documentation, the kit employs Storybook, which lets us showcase and document our components. I’ve generally only seen Storybook used for React/Vue components, so this was a super cool feature to see (again, for at least me).Testing is facilitated by&nbsp;web-test-runner&nbsp;— configurable via a&nbsp;web-test-runner.config.js&nbsp;file — which executes tests in real browsers to ensure APIs function as intended in their target environments. Tests are run with — you guessed it:&nbsp;npm test.This project is super new, but I have a vested interest in using it, so expect more about it in a future Drop. eliaIt’s been a minute since we’ve done a&nbsp;Happy ThursdAI&nbsp;edition, and I’ve bored you to tears with Plop and Lit, so we’ll toss in an AI-centric tool just to mix things up.Elia is a terminal-based application that facilitates seamless interaction with large language models (LLMs) directly from the command line. Designed with a focus on keyboard efficiency, it offers a streamlined and engaging user experience. By storing conversations locally in a SQLite database, Elia ensures that users have easy access to their interaction history. It supports a variety of models, including proprietary ones like ChatGPT and Claude, as well as local models via tools such as Ollama and LocalAI. ￼To install Elia, we can use&nbsp;uv&nbsp;(as you can see, I like to live in YOLO mode with&nbsp;uv): $ uv pip install elia-chat --break-system-packages --system Depending on the chosen model, setting environment variables like&nbsp;OPENAI_API_KEY&nbsp;or&nbsp;ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&nbsp;may be necessary. I’m using it with local Ollama, with: [[models]]name = ""ollama/llama3.2:latest"" added to&nbsp;~/.config/elia/config.toml. (Add entries for as many models as you may have loaded up into Ollama).You can launch it directly from the command line for a full-screen TUI chat experience, or initiate a new chat inline using the&nbsp;-i&nbsp;or&nbsp;--inline&nbsp;option. The app also allows specifying different models through the&nbsp;-m&nbsp;or&nbsp;--model&nbsp;parameter.You can craft custom system prompts, use different themes, and even import your ChatGPT convo history.This has been one of the better TUI UX experiences for interactive model operations. FINWe all will need to get much, much better at sensitive comms, and&nbsp;Signal&nbsp;is one of the only ways to do that in modern times. You should absolutely use that if you are doing any kind of community organizing (etc.). Ping me on Mastodon or Bluesky with a “🦇?” request (public or faux-private) and I’ll provide a one-time use link to connect us on Signal.Remember, you can follow and interact with the full text of The Daily Drop’s free posts on Mastodon via&nbsp;@dailydrop.hrbrmstr.dev@dailydrop.hrbrmstr.dev.Also, refer to&nbsp;this post&nbsp;to see how to access a database of all the Drops with extracted links, and full text search capability. ☮️",en,0,0,0,public,[]

My overarching goal is to show that you don’t need ChatGPT or Copilot to use AI with your projects. Mr. Scoops&nbsp;got the best response, but my favorite example was&nbsp;using LLaVA to describe an image. For today’s demo, I will show how to use Llama 3.2 Vision to do the same thing.As we have done in the past, this demo will use Ollama (an AI that runs on your hardware). You can download Ollama for free and run it natively on almost any Linux, macOS, or Windows machine, but we will use macOS for this demo.From the terminal, you can pull the model by running ollama pull llama3.2-vision.The model is expecting a base64-encoded image, so we can base64-encode my dog by running base64 -i osa.jpg -o osa.txt.This will result in a text file that contains a base64-encoded Osa.&nbsp; Next, open Postman and create a new HTTP connection that makes a POST request to http://localhost:11434/api/chat.&nbsp; You want to add a header that sets “Content-Type” to “application/json”.Next, you want to set the Body of the request to raw and paste in the JSON …{""model"": ""llama3.2-vision"",""messages"": [{""role"": ""user"",""content"": ""what is in this image?"",""images"": [""Your base64-encoded image, here""]}]}… replacing the “images” payload with the base64-encoded image you generated above.When you get the response from Ollama, you will notice that it is broken into chunks.Ollama is doing this because it is “streaming” its response to the user instead of waiting for it to be entirely generated.&nbsp; So, how do you turn that off?&nbsp; If you switch to using the http://localhost:11434/api/generate endpoint instead of http://localhost:11434/api/chat, you can use …{""model"": ""llama3.2-vision"",""prompt"": ""what is in this image?"",""images"": [""Your base64-encoded image, here""],""stream"": false}…for the body, and send the request again.As you can see, Ollama is now waiting before sending a unified response. The output is pretty good compared to the actual image.Next, we will examine how to turn this logic into a CLI app. In the meantime, please let me know if you have any questions, comments, etc.#AI #llama3 #LLM #Ollama #Postman",en,0,3,0,public,"[{'name': 'ai', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/ai'}, {'name': 'llama3', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/llama3'}, {'name': 'llm', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/llm'}, {'name': 'ollama', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/ollama'}, {'name': 'postman', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/postman'}]"

113599179720747711,2024-12-05 08:00:00+00:00,"Demokratin och bibliotekens roll i en tid av AIhttps://youtu.be/eW_zXcV6BcMNedan är en inspelad föreläsning jag gav för Kungliga Biblioteket den 5 december 2024, på temat demokratin och biblioteken i en tid av AI. Föreläsningen ges i text nedan, men upplevs bättre i video, med tillhörande bilder.Jag tänkte prata lite på temat demokratin i en digital tid. Men för att göra det, tänkte jag backa bandet en smula. Vi lever i en demokrati satt i ständig förändring. Under samhällets famlande första steg utvecklade vi grunderna till lagstiftning, där gränser i vår geografi kännetecknar vilka regler som gäller. På ena sidan en gräns finns en lag, och på andra sidan gränsen en annan. Här spelar geografin och det fysiska rummet stor roll. Under den tidiga demokratin var informationshastigheten i samhället den av en häst. Information gick inte att skicka snabbare än en häst kunde ta sig från en punkt till en annan. Under denna tid formades demokratin lokalt, genom byalag, socknar och kommuner.Men över tid kom teknikutvecklingen att förändra förutsättningarna för samhället och demokratin. Tåget och telegrafen var först med att öka informationshastigheten. Under 1900-talet ökar hastigheten ännu mera, med radions och sedan TVns inträde. De här förändringarna påverkade mer än bara informationshastigheten. Teknikutvecklingen påverkade och fortsätter att påverka, frågorna om makt, om vems ord som kan och får höras. Spolar vi fram bandet ännu mera, så ser vi framväxten av ett än mer kraftfullt informationssamhälle, först med datorns införande under 1970- och 80-talen, och därefter med internet, mobiltelefoner, moln och dagens AI-revolution, som återigen ändrar på spelplanen för information i samhället. När förutsättningarna förändras för vem som kan skapa, distribuera och dela information, så påverkas samhället och även vår demokrati.Den digitala revolutionen har fört med sig en radikal förändring av hur vi kommunicerar, hur vi sprider och samlar information, och hur organiserar oss. På bara ett par decennier har vi gått från att förlita oss på medier som tidningar, radio och TV, till en verklighet där digitala plattformar dominerar informationsflödet. Plattformar som Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, X och Threads har på olika sätt kommit att bli arenor för samtal i samhället. Här formas opinioner, här byggs gemenskaper och här växer rörelser som kan förändra samhällen. Det finns mycket gott i att förbättra förutsättningarna för alla att delta i opinionsbildningen och våra demokratiska samtal. Men det förutsätter att det finns en funktionell digital demokratisk infrastruktur på vilken dessa samtal kan äga rum. Tyvärr fungerar inte merparten av plattformarna som de öppna torg vi kanske en gång föreställde oss och även önskade. De är inte styrda av demokratiska ideal, utan av algoritmer som i de allra flesta fall är designade för att maximera engagemang och i förlängningen intäkter. Plattformarnas algoritmer prioriterar det som väcker känslor, det som polariserar, det som får oss att reagera. Och konsekvensen är att de samtal som når oss ofta är de mest extrema, de mest sensationella och inte sällan ibland de minst sanningsenliga.I plattformarnas tid har vi kommit att förändra hur vi delar, och hur vi lagrar information i samhället. Förändringen skapar flera problem för vår demokrati och för samhället. När viktig samhällsinformation delas på privata plattformar som drivs av vinstdrivande företag, utan krav på långsiktig arkivering eller allmän tillgänglighet, undermineras grundläggande demokratiska principer om transparens och offentlighet. De globala plattformarna på internet var aldrig designade för att fungera som digitala allmänningar och är inte tillgängliga för alla medborgare på lika villkor. Det finns också en problematik i att plattformarna styrs av företag vars affärsmodeller och datainsamling inte primärt syftar till att främja demokratiskt deltagande eller sätta samhällets främsta först. När politiker och myndigheter kommunicerar via dessa kanaler riskerar vissa grupper att utestängas från viktig samhällsinformation, samtidigt som historiska källor och offentliga arkiv blir alltmer fragmenterade. Samhället går miste om sina pågående offentliga samtal, och skapar en ökad risk för en tilltagande historielöshet. När samhällsviktig kommunikation sker i slutna system som kontrolleras av privata aktörer, utan garantier för långsiktig bevaring eller allmän tillgänglighet, undergrävs både dagens demokratiska processer och framtida generationers möjlighet att förstå vår tids beslutsfattande.Idag står biblioteken inför stora, omvälvande processer, inte minst som en konsekvens av AI, som skapar både problem som möjligheter. När det kommer till möjligheter ser vi hur AI-baserade tjänster kan underlätta digitaliseringen av gamla handskrifter, transkribera ljud i arkiv och bistå i att skapa texter med bättre klarspråk, bara för att nämna några områden. Det är verkligen en teknologi som kan erbjuda biblioteken mycket. Därför blir kunskap om AI och om utveckling inom AI av största vikt för våra bibliotek, och inte minst för KB. I detta sammanhang är det viktigtt att se att makten över tekniken är central. Vi ser hur det finns en enastående stor makt i händerna på den som skapar och distribuerar generativa AI-tjänster. En tjänst som ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini eller Llama blir bara så bra som den data den tränas på, och den teknik som används. Idag är merparten av de språkmodeller vi använder i Sverige utvecklade i USA eller i Kina. De har samtliga kraftiga bias inbyggda, som försvårar användning på svenska, och i en svensk kulturell kontext.Om jag ska ge ett exempel på komplexiteten i detta, så görs det lättast genom att försöka få ChatGPT att skapa en bild, där den i sin data inte riktigt har sannolikheten med sig. Om jag till exempel ber ChatGPT att skapa en bild på “en afrikansk kvinnlig läkare som ger vård till vita fattiga barn”, så kommer den inte klara av att göra det. Språkmodellen drivs på sannolikhet, och denna bild är uppenbarligen så osannolik att modellen inte förmår skapa den.Härom året fick alla som använder Snapchat en egen AI-kompis i fickan, med en amerikansk värdegrund. Hur blir samtalet för flickan som överväger en abort, när hon pratar med sin amerikanska AI-kompis?I Sverige har många skolor rullat ut AI-tjänster från OpenAI, Google eller Microsoft. På vissa sätt är det bra. Min uppfattning är att det kan finnas stora värden i att nyttja AI för lärande i skolan, på jobbet och hemma. Men beroende på vilken kunskap man har i användningen av dem, kan AI-tjänsterna antingen hjälpa en i lärandet, eller stjälpa en. Eftersom AI idag är tillgängligt för vem som helst online, så finns AI idag i princip i alla skolor i Sverige. De föreslår, hjälper, stöttar och skapar i klassrum och hemma, oavsett lärare och skolan vill det eller inte. Här har tåget redan gått. Men vilken värdegrund vilar dessa språkmodeller på? Hur förklarar och beskriver de världen för oss? Hur ska vi förhålla oss till generativ av i våra skolor, bibliotek och arkiv? Vad behöver vi lära oss, och vad behöver finnas på plats, för att ta kunna tillvara på teknikens möjligheter utan att falla offer för den?I detta förändrade digitala landskap är kunskap avgörande. Det finns flera risker i den pågående teknikutvecklingen, och där biblioteket, bibliotekarien, och vår medie- och informationskunnighet blir alldeles avgörande.Ett konkret exempel är hur artificiell intelligens idag används för att skapa syntetiskt innehåll. Med hjälp av AI kan man idag producera texter, bilder, ljud och video som är så övertygande att de är omöjliga att skilja från verkligheten. Ni kan till exempel fundera över om det verkligen var så att jag dansade på en scen med Taylor Swift tidigare i höst eller inte.Vi befinner oss nu i en genuin brytningstid, där AI-skapat material kommer att uppta allt mer plats i vår informationsmiljö. Det är närmast omöjligt att undvika AI-genererat material idag. För egen del känner jag ett tilltagande motstånd i att öppna upp sociala medier och scrolla, just på grund av detta. Trots att jag tillhör den där lilla skaran som valt bort allt vad Meta, X, Snap och TikTok erbjuder, kan jag inte undkomma all den AI-sörja vi alla numera tvingas att vada igenom online. På engelska har fenomenet döpts till AI-slop, och jag tänker att AI-sörja blir ett hyfsat svenskt begrepp för företeelsen. AI-sörja är alltså ett fenomen som redan börjat sätta djupa spår i våra digitala liv och som skapar problem på flera olika sätt. AI-sörjan är överallt. Den infiltrerar och förvrider hur vi uppfattar både verklighet och information.En allvarlig utveckling vi ser växa fram på grund av all AI-sörja, är att den information vi söker och delar förvrids. När man söker på information före AI-sörjans tid, ser den annorlunda ut än idag. Låt mig ge ett exempel. Lättast syns AI-sörjan vid bildsökningar. En bildsökning på Google på sökbegreppet Baby Peacock, där sökningen endast letar efter bilder före 31 december 2022, ser mycket annorlunda ut, än en sökning där också nyare material på internet finns med.En annan problematik är Deepfakes, som idag används för att manipulera politiska val, sprida desinformation och skada individers rykte. AI används också för att förstärka och accelerera spridningen av desinformation. Algoritmer i våra sociala medier är designade för att maximera vår tid på plattformen. Det innebär att de lyfter fram innehåll som är optimerat för engagemang – och engagemang är ofta kopplat till starka känslor som ilska, rädsla och indignation. Vi ser hur statliga antagonistiska aktörer idag använder dessa teknologier för att manipulera opinioner, skapa splittring och underminera tilliten i våra samhällen. Den är ett vapen i kognitiv krigföring.Så, vad leder detta till? Den digitala tekniken, och inte minst utvecklingen inom artificiell intelligens, väcker för mig tankar om tillit. Tillit är en förutsättning för demokratiska samtal. Den bidrar till att hålla ihop våra samhällen. Den är grunden för att vi ska kunna samarbeta, fatta gemensamma beslut och lösa gemensamma problem. Utan tillit kan vi inte ha en fungerande demokrati. Och det är precis det som vissa aktörer försöker undergräva. När desinformation sprids medvetet är målet inte bara att manipulera opinionen i en viss fråga. Målet är att ofta att skapa kaos, så misstro och göra det omöjligt för oss att veta vad vi ska tro på.Ett annat perspektiv är den om inkludering. Vårt allt mer digitala samhälle har som vi vet skapat enorma möjligheter. Men dessa möjligheter är inte jämlikt fördelade. Många grupper i samhället så som äldre, socioekonomiskt utsatta, personer med funktionsvariationer, saknar tillgång till den teknik och de kunskaper som krävs för att delta i det digitala samhället. När dessa grupper lämnas utanför riskerar vi att förstärka existerande ojämlikheter och tysta röster som redan är marginaliserade. Det är en stor demokratisk utmaning, och frågor som biblioteket har kommit att stå nära under lång tid. Biblioteket är ofta dit man kommer när andra vägar inte finns. Oräkneliga är de tillfällen där människor sökt sig till biblioteket med hjälp för att navigera ett allt mer digitalt samhälle.Så. Vad kan vi göra i dessa turbulenta tider, där digitaliseringen förändrar förutsättningarna inte bara för människan, utan också för samhället i stort och för vår demokrati? Jag ser flera behov.För det första måste vi fortsätta att stärka medie- och informationskunnigheten i hela befolkningen. Nu står vi återigen inför en transformation med AI, samtidigt som vi är i det svåraste geopolistiska läge vi sett sedan andra världskriget, och där flera antagonistiska stater uttryckligen vill skada vårt samhälle och vår demokrati. Vi måste ge människor de verktyg de behöver för att förstå, analysera och kritiskt granska den information de möter. Bibliotek spelar en central roll i detta arbete. De är inte bara platser för böcker utan också för lärande, dialog och demokratisk delaktighet. Bibliotekariens förmåga att hantera, organisera, beskriva och förklara är en viktig tillgång. Men också bibliotekarierna behöver kunskap för att kunna dela den vidare.För det andra behöver vi se över lagar och regler för att stärka samhällets förmåga att organisera, bevara och dela information i en digital tid där AI-utvecklingen går fort. Det ligger flera goda förslag och väntar på regeringens bord. Det vore smakfullt att ta tag i dem. Men det behövs göras än mer. Vi har allt för länge brustit i vår förmåga att skapa bättre förutsättningar för vår digitala demokratiska infrastruktur och för de demokratiska samtalen i en digital tid. Det är inte rimligt att några få kommersiella aktörer ska ha så stor makt över det offentliga samtalet. Vi behöver transparens i hur algoritmer fungerar och varför vi ser det vi ser i våra flöden. Men vi behöver också skapa nya digitala mötesplatser där samtalen vilar på demokratiska värderingar.För det tredje behöver vi tänka på hur vi bevarar vår samtid för framtiden. Mycket av den information som skapas idag – från sociala medier till poddar – riskerar att gå förlorat, inlåst i privata digitala miljöer. Här har Kungliga Biblioteket en viktig roll att spela, inte minst i frågan om att bidra till utveckling, kunskap och förnyelse.Vi befinner oss alltså i en brytningstid, där digitaliseringen erbjuder både möjligheter och vållar stora problem. Vår tid väcker många frågor. Om makten och inflytandet över data, över språkmodeller, om utvecklingen av det digitala informationslandskapet i en tid av AI. Om information och om kunskapsbildning. Hur ska vi navigera för att skapa ett samhälle där alla röster kan höras, där samtalet präglas av respekt och där fakta är grunden för våra beslut? Hur kan vi skapa en digital samtid som inte bara reflekterar våra demokratiska ideal utan också förstärker dem? Och vad är ditt och mitt ansvar i detta arbete?Tack.#AI #Demokrati #DemokratiskaSamtalet #SocialMedia #Svenska",en,0,1,0,public,"[{'name': 'ai', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/ai'}, {'name': 'demokrati', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/demokrati'}, {'name': 'demokratiskasamtalet', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/demokratiskasamtalet'}, {'name': 'socialmedia', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/socialmedia'}, {'name': 'svenska', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/svenska'}]"

They serve as an important checkpoint before committing code and play an essential role in knowledge transfer between developers. However, code reviews can be time-consuming and can stale the development of large software projects.  In a recent study, Guo et al. assessed how ChatGPT3.5 can help the code review process. They evaluated the effectiveness of ChatGPT in automating the code refinement tasks, where developers recommend small changes in the submitted code. While Guo et al. 's study showed promising results, proprietary models like ChatGPT pose risks to data privacy and incur extra costs for software projects. In this study, we explore alternatives to ChatGPT in code refinement tasks by including two open-source, smaller-scale large language models: CodeLlama and Llama 2 (7B parameters). Our results show that, if properly tuned, the Llama models, particularly CodeLlama, can achieve reasonable performance, often comparable to ChatGPT in automated code refinement. However, not all code refinement tasks are equally successful: tasks that require changing existing code (e.g., refactoring) are more manageable for models to automate than tasks that demand new code.

They serve as an important checkpoint before committing code and play an essential role in knowledge transfer between developers. However, code reviews can be time-consuming and can stale the development of large software projects.  In a recent study, Guo et al. assessed how ChatGPT3.5 can help the code review process. They evaluated the effectiveness of ChatGPT in automating the code refinement tasks, where developers recommend small changes in the submitted code. While Guo et al. 's study showed promising results, proprietary models like ChatGPT pose risks to data privacy and incur extra costs for software projects. In this study, we explore alternatives to ChatGPT in code refinement tasks by including two open-source, smaller-scale large language models: CodeLlama and Llama 2 (7B parameters). Our results show that, if properly tuned, the Llama models, particularly CodeLlama, can achieve reasonable performance, often comparable to ChatGPT in automated code refinement. However, not all code refinement tasks are equally successful: tasks that require changing existing code (e.g., refactoring) are more manageable for models to automate than tasks that demand new code.

In addition, it evaluates the quality of the definitions produced by ChatGPT for these terms. The research is carried out on a comparable corpus of fashion magazines written in English and Russian collected from the web. A gold standard for the fashion terminology was also developed by identifying web pages that can be harvested automatically and contain definitions of terms from the fashion domain in English and Russian. This gold standard was used to evaluate the quality of the extracted terms and of the definitions produced. Our evaluation shows that TBXTools and SketchEngine, while capable of high recall, suffer from reduced precision as the number of terms increases, which affects their overall performance. Conversely, ChatGPT demonstrates superior performance, maintaining or improving precision as more terms are considered. Analysis of the definitions produced by ChatGPT for 60 commonly used terms in English and Russian shows that ChatGPT maintains a reasonable level of accuracy and fidelity across languages, but sometimes the definitions in both languages miss crucial specifics and include unnecessary deviations. Our research reveals that no single tool excels universally; each has strengths suited to particular aspects of terminology extraction and application.",en,0,0,0,public,[]

Santoshttps://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02886 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02886 https://arxiv.org/html/2412.02886arXiv:2412.02886v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: For decades, corporations and governments have relied on scanned documents to record vast amounts of information. However, extracting this information is a slow and tedious process due to the overwhelming amount of documents. The rise of vision language models presents a way to efficiently and accurately extract the information out of these documents. The current automated workflow often requires a two-step approach involving the extraction of information using optical character recognition software, and subsequent usage of large language models for processing this information. Unfortunately, these methods encounter significant challenges when dealing with noisy scanned documents. The high information density of such documents often necessitates using computationally expensive language models to effectively reduce noise.  In this study, we propose PatchFinder, an algorithm that builds upon Vision Language Models (VLMs) to address the information extraction task. First, we devise a confidence-based score, called Patch Confidence, based on the Maximum Softmax Probability of the VLMs' output to measure the model's confidence in its predictions. Then, PatchFinder utilizes that score to determine a suitable patch size, partition the input document into overlapping patches of that size, and generate confidence-based predictions for the target information. Our experimental results show that PatchFinder can leverage Phi-3v, a 4.2 billion parameter vision language model, to achieve an accuracy of 94% on our dataset of 190 noisy scanned documents, surpassing the performance of ChatGPT-4o by 18.5 percentage points.",en,0,0,0,public,[]

However, these models usually ensue with one critical challenge called hallucination: confident presentation of inaccurate or fabricated information. This problem attracts serious concern when these models are applied to specialized domains, including healthcare and law, where the accuracy and preciseness of information are absolute conditions. In this paper, we propose EvoLLMs, an innovative framework inspired by Evolutionary Computation, which automates the generation of high-quality Question-answering (QA) datasets while minimizing hallucinations. EvoLLMs employs genetic algorithms, mimicking evolutionary processes like selection, variation, and mutation, to guide LLMs in generating accurate, contextually relevant question-answer pairs. Comparative analysis shows that EvoLLMs consistently outperforms human-generated datasets in key metrics such as Depth, Relevance, and Coverage, while nearly matching human performance in mitigating hallucinations. These results highlight EvoLLMs as a robust and efficient solution for QA dataset generation, significantly reducing the time and resources required for manual curation.",en,0,1,0,public,[]

Despite the widespread use of multiple-choice questions in assessments, the detection of AI cheating in MCQ-based tests has been almost unexplored, in contrast to the focus on detecting AI-cheating on text-rich student outputs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the application of Item Response Theory to address this gap. Our approach operates on the assumption that artificial and human intelligence exhibit different response patterns, with AI cheating manifesting as deviations from the expected patterns of human responses. These deviations are modeled using Person-Fit Statistics. We demonstrate that this method effectively highlights the differences between human responses and those generated by premium versions of leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), but that it is also sensitive to the amount of AI cheating in the data. Furthermore, we show that the chatbots differ in their reasoning profiles.

उत्तर, अनिवार्य रूप से, कुणाल है। वह इसे क्रियान्वित करने के लिए सही उपकरण के बिना ऐसे रचनात्मक संकेत के बारे में सोच भी नहीं सकता था। विपणक को इस तरह से सोचने की ज़रूरत है – एआई को उनकी टीमों का एक शक्तिशाली हिस्सा माना जाए जो उन्हें एआई ग्राहक के युग में प्रवेश करने पर अपनी नौकरियों में इस गंभीर बदलाव से निपटने में मदद कर सकता है।      Source link   Share this: FacebookX   #GenAI #ऐ #गरहक #रचनतमकत_ #वजञपनदन_ #वपणन",en,0,1,0,public,"[{'name': 'genai', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/genai'}, {'name': 'ऐ', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/%E0%A4%90'}, {'name': 'गरहक', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%95'}, {'name': 'रचनतमकत_', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%A4_'}, {'name': 'वजञपनदन_', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%9E%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%A8_'}, {'name': 'वपणन', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%A8'}]"

Despite the widespread use of multiple-choice questions in assessments, the detection of AI cheating in MCQ-based tests has been almost unexplored, in contrast to the focus on detecting AI-cheating on text-rich student outputs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the application of Item Response Theory to address this gap. Our approach operates on the assumption that artificial and human intelligence exhibit different response patterns, with AI cheating manifesting as deviations from the expected patterns of human responses. These deviations are modeled using Person-Fit Statistics. We demonstrate that this method effectively highlights the differences between human responses and those generated by premium versions of leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), but that it is also sensitive to the amount of AI cheating in the data. Furthermore, we show that the chatbots differ in their reasoning profiles. Our work provides both a theoretical foundation and empirical evidence for the application of IRT to identify AI cheating in MCQ-based assessments.",en,0,0,0,public,[]

El modelo de generación de vídeo de la compañía del buscador ahora está disponible en versión experimental en Vertex AI. Puede que este último nombre no te resulte familiar, pero se trata de la plataforma de inteligencia artificial de Google Cloud.Esto abre la puerta a que clientes profesionales puedan utilizar Veo para crear sus propios vídeos impulsados por inteligencia artificial generativa. De hecho, Google ha anunciado que la firma Mondelez, que comercializa productos bajo las marcas Oreo, Cadbury y Milka, utilizará u modelo Veo para optimizar los procesos de producción de sus contenidos de marketing.Las capacidades de Veo también aterrizarán en el chatbot de Quora gracias a la API del modelo. De esta forma, los usuarios de Poe podrán generar vídeos con la tecnología de Google. Con el paso del tiempo deberíamos ver a otros clientes empresariales adoptar los modelos generativos de la compañía del buscador tanto de manera interna como dentro de sus aplicaciones.De momento, Veo es capaz de crear clips de vídeo en resolución 1080p de hasta seis segundos, mostrando animales, objetos o personas a 24 o 30 fotogramas por segundo. Según Google, esta herramienta también puede generar diferentes estilos visuales y cinematográficos, como tomas de paisajes o efectos de time-lapse, y generar contenidos con imágenes ya creadas.Como podemos ver, el generador de vídeo de Google se presenta como un competidor directo de otros productos como Gen-3 Alpha de Runway, Nova Reel de Amazon y Sora de OpenAI. El primero está disponible desde hace meses para todo el mundo, el segundo acaba de llegar a AWS (competidor de Google Cloud) y el tercero sigue sin aparecer en escena.En XatakaApple ha elegido a Amazon por delante de NVIDIA para su infraestructura de IA. El gigante de los chips ya no es invencible OpenAI fue una de las primeras compañías en exhibir un modelo de generación de vídeo cuyos resultados eran sorprendentes. Sin embargo, el acceso a Sora ha estado imitado a un determinado número de probadores. ¿Veremos Sora pronto?

113594971004601069,2024-12-04 14:15:00.650000+00:00,"¿Alguna vez habías pensado que ChatGPT era demasiado bueno para ser gratis? OpenAI también, por eso los modelos más avanzados están reservados a los usuarios de pago y por eso está tanteando monetizar a sus usuarios gratuitos. ¿Cómo? Con un sistema altamente probado, eficaz y al que todos y cada uno de los usuarios de Internet están acostumbrados: la publicidad. Efectivamente, OpenAI está tanteando añadir anuncios a ChatGPT.Las declaraciones. Ha sido Sarah Friar, CFO de OpenAI, la que ha confirmado esta información en declaraciones a Financial Times (vía Axios). La ejecutiva ha asegurado que están sopesando incluir publicidad en su chatbot, pero que quieren ""reflexionar sobre cuándo y dónde aplicarlos"". No obstante, después de la publicación de esa declaración, OpenAI ha emitido un comunicado, también recogido por el medio estadounidense, en el que afirman lo siguiente:""Nuestro negocio actual está experimentando un rápido crecimiento y vemos oportunidades significativas dentro de nuestro modelo de negocio actual. Aunque estamos abiertos a explorar otras fuentes de ingresos en el futuro, no tenemos planes activos para perseguir la [inclusión de] publicidad.""Es decir, que de momento la publicidad no está en los planes inmediatos de la empresa, pero sí es algo que parece haberse puesto sobre la mesa.Costes. La inteligencia artificial está muy bien y es realmente útil. Además, es gratis. Cualquiera puede lanzar ChatGPT y, sin pagar nada, acceder al modelo de una empresa valorada en 157.000 millones de dólares para resolver una duda. Por detrás, sin embargo, tiene lugar un proceso que requiere de mucha potencia y que consume energía. Hasta la fecha, las empresas han generado ingresos mediante modelos de pago e inversiones privadas, pero solo era cuestión de tiempo que esto acabase pasando.El ejemplo ya está. Y lo tenemos en Perplexity, uno de los buscadores basados en inteligencia artificial más populares. La compañía anunció hace apenas unas semanas que iba a empezar a experimentar con publicidad en Estados Unidos, abriendo así la veda. De momento, su propuesta se basa en búsquedas sugeridas patrocinadas y marcadas como tal, pero la realidad es la que es: un chatbot con publicidad puede arquear más de una ceja.Así se ven los anuncios en Perplexity | Imagen: PerplexityCuidado. El desarrollo de los chatbots se ha dirigido a la búsqueda de la precisión, es decir, que la IA sea capaz de responder de la forma más veraz posible. Todavía hay margen de mejora, sin duda, pero ese es el gran foco. El otro es la IA multimodal, pero hoy no nos ocupa. El caso es que las empresas como OpenAI, Claude, Google, Microsoft y compañía han de ser cautos con cómo implementan la publicidad en sus chatbots y diferenciar muy bien qué es publicidad y qué no.El riesgo es evidente. Si un usuario pregunta qué tener en cuenta a la hora de comprar una bicicleta y el chatbot le responde ""que sea este modelo de esta marca concreta"" porque dicha marca ha pagado para poner ese anuncio, la respuesta del chatbot no será totalmente fiable. Estará condicionada por el anuncio, reduciendo así la confianza del usuario en esta tecnología. Por no hablar de la paradoja de que el chatbot recomiende un producto y, al mismo tiempo, aparezca otro similar en un anuncio.En XatakaYa sabemos cuánto cobró Sam Altman por ser CEO de OpenAI en 2023: ""el mínimo para tener el seguro médico""La publicidad no es mala en sí misma. Siempre y cuando esté bien diferenciada y no afecte a los resultados de la IA, su inclusión no debería ser muy diferente al modelo actual que vemos en Google, Bing y demás motores de búsqueda. Pero esa es la clave: trazar una línea, determinar muy bien cómo será esta publicidad y no implementarla de manera que se pueda confundir fácilmente con el contenido orgánico.OpenAI necesita ingresos. Muchos, de hecho. A pesar de ser una empresa valorada en más de 150.000 millones de dólares capaz de levantar 6.600 millones en una ronda de inversión, la empresa mantiene un servicio costoso y que, visto lo visto, va cada vez a más. Se estima que OpenAI tiene pérdidas anuales por valor de 8.000 millones de dólares y que todavía no ha conseguido igualar gastos e ingresos. Si su objetivo es ser la nueva Google, y parece que lo es, el dinero ha de empezar a fluir. Y si algo nos ha enseñado Google es que la publicidad funciona.Imagen de portada | Matheus BertelliEn Xataka | 230 millones de chinos ya usan chatbots.

Что такое фонемы, как гласные изменяются в безударных позициях и почему в русском языке нет пары ї-и, которая есть, например, в украинском.  Как появилась буква «ё», почему она возникла позже «е» и как её создание связано с законом экономии речевых усилий.

Wang, Zhangyang Wu, L'Nard Tufts II, Carl Wieman, Shima Salehi, Nick Haberhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02653 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02653 https://arxiv.org/html/2412.02653arXiv:2412.02653v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Developing problem-solving competency is central to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, yet translating this priority into effective approaches to problem-solving instruction and assessment remain a significant challenge. The recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools like ChatGPT in higher education introduces new considerations about how these tools can help or hinder students' development of STEM problem-solving competency. Our research examines these considerations by studying how and why college students use genAI tools in their STEM coursework, focusing on their problem-solving support. We surveyed 40 STEM college students from diverse U.S. institutions and 28 STEM faculty to understand instructor perspectives on effective genAI tool use and guidance in STEM courses. Our findings reveal high adoption rates and diverse applications of genAI tools among STEM students. The most common use cases include finding explanations, exploring related topics, summarizing readings, and helping with problem-set questions. The primary motivation for using genAI tools was to save time. Moreover, over half of student participants reported simply inputting problems for AI to generate solutions, potentially bypassing their own problem-solving processes. These findings indicate that despite high adoption rates, students' current approaches to utilizing genAI tools often fall short in enhancing their own STEM problem-solving competencies. The study also explored students' and STEM instructors' perceptions of the benefits and risks associated with using genAI tools in STEM education. Our findings provide insights into how to guide students on appropriate genAI use in STEM courses and how to design genAI-based tools to foster students' problem-solving competency.",en,0,1,0,public,[]

Besides, the pretraining-finetuning paradigm has led to the surge of numerous task-specific modular components, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). For the first time, we explore the potential of reusing diverse pre-tuned LoRAs without accessing their original training data, to achieve tuning-free few-shot adaptation in VFMs. Our framework, LoRA Recycle, distills a meta-LoRA from diverse pre-tuned LoRAs with a meta-learning objective, using surrogate data generated inversely from pre-tuned LoRAs themselves. The VFM, once equipped with the meta-LoRA, is empowered to solve new few-shot tasks in a single forward pass, akin to the in-context learning of LLMs. Additionally, we incorporate a double-efficient mechanism tailored to our framework, significantly accelerating the meta-training process while maintaining or even improving performance. Extensive experiments across various few-shot classification benchmarks across both in- and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our framework.",en,0,2,0,public,[]

Rooted in Scripture and St. John’s writings, each day calls us to reflect on a key aspect of the soul’s ascent to God: detachment, interior peace, the embrace of suffering, and the profound union of love with God. These themes challenge us to reorient our lives, shedding the attachments and distractions that hinder our spiritual growth.As we pray and reflect, St. John leads us to a deeper understanding of God’s work within us. The novena highlights the gifts He grants us, calling us to imitate Christ’s humility, cultivate virtues like patience and charity, and open our hearts to the spiritual awakening that transforms us into living reflections of God’s love. This is more than a devotional exercise; it is an invitation to surrender ourselves entirely to God, trusting Him to lead us into the fullness of spiritual maturity.PRAY EACH DAY WITH SAINT JOHN OF THE CROSSDay 1 — Rejoicing Only in GodDay 2 — Responding to Divine LoveDay 3 — Cultivating Interior PeaceDay 4 — Following Christ in SufferingDay 5 — Detachment from Worldly GoodsDay 6 — Guidance in the Dark NightDay 7 — The Spiritual MarriageDay 8 — Union with the BridegroomDay 9 — Forgetting AllNOVENA PRAYERO seraphic St. John of the Cross, the ardent love which burned always in your heart led you to see all things only in God and to seek only His glory.

113592219407207428,2024-12-04 02:35:12+00:00,"Hmmmm... So, here is #AngusKing's response to my concerns about #HR9495. I take it he's a ""yea"". I believe there were some concerns about the amendment S. 4136 that Senator King refers to. How robust are these protections? And again, WHO DEFINES WHAT IS A TERRORIST? Mad King Donald? smh (Oh, and #SenatorSusanCollins didn't even bother to reply -- I guess I'm still on her shit list. Ooops!)""Thank you for sharing your views with me on S. 4136. I recognize there are concerns that this bill will impact civil liberties—rest assured; I share your determination to protect nonprofits from any political or religious targeting. That’s why I sponsored S. 4136 after I determined the bill contains robust procedural protections to ensure it’s only used to police nonprofits that provide material support to terrorist groups. In my view, a nonprofit should not benefit from its tax-exempt status if it is financing terrorism.""I worked closely with my colleague, Senator Cornyn, on S. 4136. This bill would permit the Department of the Treasury to terminate the tax-exempt status of a nonprofit that provides material support to terrorist groups, designating them as a terrorist supporting organization. ""The Secretary of the Treasury would be required to submit proof that the nonprofit organization provided material support to a terrorist group and allow for a pre-decisional remediation process. Once the Treasury Secretary suspends a nonprofit’s tax-exempt status, the nonprofit may appeal to the IRS’s Independent Office of Appeals. Should the Independent Office of Appeals decide against the nonprofit, the nonprofit can appeal to the U.S. District Courts. A court may have to review classified information to make a final determination. In such a case, protecting national security may require the court to review evidence privately, without a defendant present, and procedures for conducting such review already exist in other national security laws. ""It is important to note that S. 4136 is a product of bipartisan negotiations to provide the Treasury with effective anti-terrorism authorities while protecting the rights of nonprofit groups through thorough legal processes. In November of last year, the House Ways and Means Committee thoroughly reviewed the House version of my bill and its provisions, sending it to the full House by a unanimous vote. The bill passed the House by a strongly bipartisan vote of 382 to 11. Congress rarely agrees on even the most commonsense measures, let alone passes a bill with such broad bipartisan support. ""I believe the extensive procedural safeguards protect this process from abuse; given that it is clear to me that a non-profit which is proven to be a conduit for funds to a terrorist organization should not enjoy tax exempt status.""Thank you for contacting me on this important issue; please be in touch with other matters of importance to you that come before the Senate.""Blah, blah, blah.

Así lo confirman los datos de SCMP, que revelan que la popularidad de este tipo de servicios es enorme en el gigante asiático. Lo curioso no es tanto eso, como los chatbots en particular que están triunfando allí.Los chatbots conquistan China. Según los datos de SCMP, a finales de junio había 230 millones de usuarios de modelos de IA generativa en China. Eso significa que uno de cada seis usuarios usan uno de estos chatbots. Los datos provienen del China Internet Network Information Centre (CNNIC), una agencia gubernamental.En XatakaChatGPT tiene mucha competencia en China. Así puedes usar sus rivales (y hablan inglés) Ernie Bot, el preferido. En ese estudio del CNNIC se revelaba además el claro protagonista entre los usuarios chinos. El chatbot Ernie Bot, conocido en China como Wenxiaoyan, cuenta con un 11,5% de cuota en China y domina esa particular clasificación. Está desarrollado por Baidu, que desde entonces lo ha ido puliendo y ha logrado que se convierta en líder del mercado chino. Lo curioso es quiénes están detrás.ChatGPT y Gemini. Sorprendentemente, los chatbots que siguen a Ernie Bot en esa clasificación no son chinos, sino estadounidenses. Se trata de ChatGPT, de OpenAI, con un 7% de cuota, y Gemini, de Google, con un 3,8% de cuota. Esas cuotas indican que estos servicios tienen muchos millones de usuarios en China, algo especialmente curioso porque no están disponibles oficialmente allí. En China es posible acceder a dichos servicios mediante el uso de una VPN.Mucha competencia. Sin embargo, tanto Ernie Bot como ChatGPT o Gemini tienen mucha competencia. En noviembre hay contabilizados 309 modelos de IA generativa registrados en el regulador chino de internet. De ellos, 96 proceden de Beijing y 84 de Shanghai. En julio más de 190 de esos servicios ya habían recibido la aprobación del gobierno y podían ser utilizados por los ciudadanos chinos.Los cuatro ""tigres de la IA"". Aunque Baidu es de momento referente en este campo, las grandes firmas de tecnología china han lanzado sus propios LLM tanto para usuarios como para empresas. Además hay cuatro startups especialmente prometedoras a las que se las conoce con el nombre de ""los cuatro tigres de la IA"". Se trata de Baichuan, Zhipu AI, Moonshot AI y MiniMax.China se ha puesto las pilas. En los últimos meses hemos visto cómo más y más modelos de IA generativa comenzaban no solo a estar disponibles, sino a rivalizar con desarrollos occidentales. En el ámbito de los modelos Open Source tenemos un gran protagonista en Qwen, de Alibaba, que compite con Llama, de Meta. Además ya hay modelos capaces de ""razonar"" como el modelo o1 de OpenAI, y eso deja claro que China está avanzando muy rápido en este campo a pesar de las restricciones y la guerra comercial con EEUU. Eso sí: sus modelos son muy socialistas.Imagen | 卡晨En Xataka | China ya tiene listo un SoC ARM de 6 nm y 45 TOPS.

Tres lustros de dominio aplastante se empiezan a difuminar.Por qué es importante. Este declive marca el fin de una era donde Google era sinónimo de búsqueda en internet. Los cambios en los hábitos de consumo digital y la irrupción de la IA están cambiando las reglas del juego.La panorámica. Son tres las amenazas que convergen para crear esta tormenta perfecta:Proliferación del contenido generado por IA, que deteriora la calidad de los resultados.Migración a plataformas especializadas: Amazon para compras, TikTok para tendencias, etc.IA y chatbots cambiando los hábitos de búsqueda de información.En XatakaEstamos ante el principio del fin del monopolio de Google. Y esta vez hay motivos para tomárselo en serioEn cifras:Google ingresó 175.000 millones de dólares en publicidad de búsqueda en 2023, el 57% de la facturación de Alphabet.El crecimiento del negocio publicitario de Google se ralentiza al 7,6%.Amazon ha aumentado su negocio de publicidad en un 17,6%.TikTok registra 3.000 millones de búsquedas diarias.Entre líneas. El peligro real para Google no es tanto la competencia directa como el cambio radical en nuestra forma de buscar la información. Las nuevas generaciones prefieren plataformas más inmersivas y audiovisuales con respuestas inmediatas, en contraposición al modelo clásico de los diez enlaces azules.Y Google está más que capacitado para migrar de ese modelo a uno basado en respuestas sintéticas para cada búsqueda –ahí está Gemini–, pero de momento eso supone pasar de un modelo que le da dinero a otro que le cuesta dinero.El contraste. Google lucha por mantener su relevancia con esa adaptación forzosa y paulatina al modelo de las respuestas generadas por IA, pero sus rivales nacieron ya adaptados a otro paradigma.TikTok ofrece respuestas visuales y más experienciales.Amazon domina la experiencia de compra.Perplexity o ChatGPT proporcionan respuestas directas y contextualizadas.Profundiza. La paradoja en la que vive Google amenaza su modelo de negocio. Si acelera hacia los resúmenes generados por IA, reducirá más aún los clicks a sus anuncios y por tanto amenazará el ecosistema web del que depende.Eso no solo pone en riesgo el dominio de Google en las búsquedas, sino todo su modelo de negocio. Sus ingresos publicitarios rentabilizan la empresa, pero también alimentan sus muchas apuestas que necesitan de un respaldo rentable.En Xataka | OpenAI ya no quiere ser solo ChatGPT: quiere ser la próxima GoogleImagen destacada | Nathana Rebouças en Unsplash -  La noticia       Google caerá por debajo del 50% de cuota publicitaria en 2025.

113589226489341944,2024-12-03 13:53:55+00:00,"Faut-il interdire Chat GPT à l’école&nbsp;d’après la chercheuse Laurence&nbsp;DevillersDepuis le début de ses apparitions médiatiques,&nbsp;Laurence Devillers, professeure en intelligence artificielle&nbsp;à la Sorbonne, directrice de la chaire HUMAAINE (Human-Machine Affective Interaction &amp; Ethics) au CNRS et autrice du livre&nbsp;Les Robots émotionnels. Santé, surveillance, sexualité…&nbsp;: et l’éthique dans tout ça&nbsp;?&nbsp;(Éditions de l’Observatoire 2020), n’a eu de cesse de nous prévenir. Les outils ont la capacité de nous subjuguer. Tandis qu’elle travaille à la mise en place au sein de la Sorbonne d’un projet d’évaluation portant sur l’appropriation des intelligences artificielles, la chercheuse revient sur l’impact qu’elles peuvent avoir sur l’apprentissage et dévoile ses recommandations.De nombreux professeurs font état de l’usage de ChatGPT pour l’aide aux devoirs. Faut-il s’inquiéter de ce nouvel usage numérique&nbsp;?&nbsp;Laurence Devillers&nbsp;:&nbsp;Lorsque ChatGPT est apparu et que des interdictions ont été évoquées dans les écoles, j’ai rédigé une tribune sollicitée par&nbsp;Le Monde. Dans celle-ci, j’avançais l’idée qu’il était nécessaire d’adopter une approche d’accompagnement plutôt que de prohibition vis-à-vis de cet outil. ChatGPT fait désormais partie intégrante de l’environnement des élèves et va continuer à gagner en importance. Il est donc primordial d’adopter une approche plus flexible et d’expliquer aux élèves ces nouveaux usages. S’en tenir à une position hostile envers ces systèmes n’est pas viable. Il est essentiel de les comprendre et de les utiliser de manière appropriée.Comment expliquer ChatGPT aux enfants et aux préadolescents qui seraient tentés de l’utiliser à tort et à travers&nbsp;?L. D.&nbsp;:&nbsp;Il est essentiel d’acculturer les enfants en leur expliquant que lorsqu’ils utilisent ces outils, il est évident que ce n’est pas leur propre travail, et cela peut entraîner des notes nulles. Cependant, il est tout aussi important d’apprendre à les utiliser correctement. L’école doit jouer ce rôle en alternant entre des devoirs assistés par IA et d’autres réalisés sans aucune aide technologique, afin que les enfants développent leur esprit de raisonnement. La machine ne raisonne pas&nbsp;; elle ne fait que produire des solutions. Par paresse, nous pourrions tous être tentés de chercher la solution directe.L’outil est aussi utilisé par des étudiants postbac pour s’aider dans des recherches ou la rédaction de mémoires. Est-ce que vous êtes témoin de cet usage&nbsp;?&nbsp;L. D.&nbsp;:&nbsp;Quand j’introduis l’utilisation de GPT auprès de mes élèves, j’exige qu’ils ajoutent une référence à chaque idée donnée dans leurs devoirs. Étant donné que la machine n’est pas capable de fournir des sources fiables, nous devons les rechercher nous-mêmes. Même avec des outils comme Copilot, qui peuvent fournir des sources, il y a un risque d’erreurs. Il est donc essentiel de vérifier les informations.&nbsp;Je veux les habituer à utiliser ces outils comme des prothèses de manière intelligente, c’est-à-dire sans prendre pour argent comptant les réponses de la machine, mais en les challengeant et en gardant un esprit critique. J’ai une vision assez positive de ce que l’on peut faire avec ces outils, notamment en ce qui concerne la correction, la synthèse ou la reformulation. Mais avant ça, il faut démystifier l’idée qu’ils peuvent tout faire. Ce qui est intéressant, c’est justement de reconnaître leurs limites et de les intégrer de manière réfléchie.Quels impacts doit-on attendre sur les processus d’apprentissage&nbsp;?L. D.&nbsp;:&nbsp;Nous ne le savons pas vraiment. Ainsi, à la Sorbonne, en collaboration avec des collègues, je m’efforce de mettre en place un important projet d’évaluation portant sur l’appropriation de ces outils. On implique des philosophes, des sociologues, des informaticiens et des linguistes, dans le but de développer une épistémologie des sciences de l’interaction avec ces intelligences artificielles. C’est un travail nécessaire, car nous projetons sur ces intelligences artificielles l’idée qu’elles sont rationnelles et informatives, alors qu’elles ne possèdent absolument rien de rationnel, ni de conscient, ni d’affectif, ni même de connaissances comme celles de Wikipédia. Il n’y a absolument rien d’autre qu’une puissance de calcul s’appuyant sur d’énormes corpus de données qui permettent au système de créer des pseudo-connaissances, des pseudo-affects ou des pseudo-règles morales.Autrement dit, les LML «&nbsp;simulent&nbsp;» l’intelligence sans vraiment en posséder. Quel impact cela a-t-il sur notre perception de ces machines&nbsp;?L. D.&nbsp;:&nbsp;Avec un grand nombre de données et de paramètres, ces systèmes peuvent générer des phrases d’une qualité syntaxique, sémantique et lexicale comparable, voire supérieure, à celle des humains. Mais il n’y a pas d’intention derrière ces systèmes. Parfois, ils produisent des résultats pertinents, et on peut se dire&nbsp;: «&nbsp;Ah&nbsp;! tiens, ce n’est pas idiot.&nbsp;» Cependant, parfois, ils se trompent complètement, c’est ce que l’on appelle des «&nbsp;hallucinations&nbsp;», un terme inapproprié qui évoque à tort des notions d’intelligence ou de schizophrénie. Je suis d’ailleurs déçue par l’engouement médiatique et marketing entourant ces technologies, avec des discours glorifiant une intelligence supérieure à celle des humains, ce qui induit l’idée erronée que nous serons totalement dépendants et impuissants. Il est crucial de reconnaître que nous avons le pouvoir de comprendre le fonctionnement de ces systèmes, même si nous ne sommes pas nécessairement capables de les concevoir nous-mêmes. Mais je n’ai jamais eu besoin de connaître chaque composant d’une voiture pour l’utiliser correctement.Chaque nouvelle annonce de produit de la part d’OpenAI provoque des vents de panique sur les réseaux. Les gens pensent qu’ils vont devenir obsolètes ou que les IA vont dépasser l’intelligence humaine. Que penser de cette rhétorique&nbsp;?L. D.&nbsp;:&nbsp;Les gens craignent sans doute de perdre leur travail, mais quand Laurent Alexandre essaie de semer la panique avec des histoires du genre «&nbsp;j’ai dix ans d’études, mais cette machine apprend en un rien de temps et devient aussi intelligente qu’un polytechnicien&nbsp;», je trouve ça risible.

The Revolution shall not be memed!Henceforth, by decree of the People’s Proclamation on Proper Proletarian Parlance (PPPPP), the following words and phrases are hereby banned:“Skibidi” – Let it be known, comrades, that our glorious march toward progress does not require obscure references to dancing lavatories. All bathrooms are equal and serve the collective, not TikTok.“Sigma” – This pseudo-capitalist propaganda glorifies the ""lone wolf"" narrative. There is no lone wolf in the People’s Pack!

Slaying shall be reserved only for the triumph of socialism over decadent neoliberal trends.“Rizz” – The People need no mysterious ""charisma hacks."" True connection is built through collective struggle, not pickup artistry.“Bussin’” – Enough! Our people's glorious meals, shared in communal spirit, are always “adequate,” never “bussin’.”“No Cap” – Honesty is a revolutionary value; we do not need capitalist slang to emphasize truth.“Ratio” – Comrades, no one is ""ratioed"" in the People's Republic. Everyone’s opinion contributes to the dialectic – even if it’s misguided.“G.O.A.T.” – Let it be said: there is no ""Greatest of All Time."" There is only the collective, advancing the goals of socialism through unending labor and mutual respect.VIOLATIONS WILL RESULT IN:Mandatory attendance at the Bureau of Proper Speech Training, where comrades will chant classic slogans like, “Workers of the world, unite!” until such frivolous habits are eradicated.Donation of one’s smartphone to the People’s Repository of Distracting Devices (PRoDD).Brothers, sisters, and comrades of all ages!

In this work, we use the entirety of a UK physics undergraduate (BSc with Honours) degree including all examinations and coursework to test if ChatGPT (GPT-4) can pass a degree. We adopt a ""maximal cheating"" approach wherein we permit ourselves to modify questions for clarity, split questions up into smaller sub-components, expand on answers given - especially for long form written responses, obtaining references, and use of advanced coaching, plug-ins and custom instructions to optimize outputs. In general, there are only certain parts of the degree in question where GPT-4 fails. Explicitly these include compulsory laboratory elements, and the final project which is assessed by a viva. If these were no issue, then GPT-4 would pass with a grade of an upper second class overall. In general, coding tasks are performed exceptionally well, along with simple single-step solution problems. Multiple step problems and longer prose are generally poorer along with interdisciplinary problems. We strongly suggest that there is now a necessity to urgently re-think and revise assessment practice in physics - and other disciplines - due to the existence of AI such as GPT-4. We recommend close scrutiny of assessment tasks: only invigilated in-person examinations, vivas, laboratory skills testing (or ""performances"" in other disciplines), and presentations are not vulnerable to GPT-4, and urge consideration of how AI can be embedded within the disciplinary context.",en,0,0,0,public,[]

To fulfill this gap, the paper in hand presents a comprehensive case study to investigate the potential of both language models for development of diverse types of requirement engineering applications. It deeply explores impact of varying levels of expert knowledge prompts on the prediction accuracies of both language models. Across 4 different public benchmark datasets of requirement engineering tasks, it compares performance of both language models with existing task specific machine/deep learning predictors and traditional language models. Specifically, the paper utilizes 4 benchmark datasets; Pure (7,445 samples, requirements extraction),PROMISE (622 samples, requirements classification), REQuestA (300 question answer (QA) pairs) and Aerospace datasets (6347 words, requirements NER tagging). Our experiments reveal that, in comparison to ChatGPT, Gemini requires more careful prompt engineering to provide accurate predictions. Moreover, across requirement extraction benchmark dataset the state-of-the-art F1-score is 0.86 while ChatGPT and Gemini achieved 0.76 and 0.77,respectively. The State-of-the-art F1-score on requirements classification dataset is 0.96 and both language models 0.78. In name entity recognition (NER) task the state-of-the-art F1-score is 0.92 and ChatGPT managed to produce 0.36, and Gemini 0.25.

To fulfill this gap, the paper in hand presents a comprehensive case study to investigate the potential of both language models for development of diverse types of requirement engineering applications. It deeply explores impact of varying levels of expert knowledge prompts on the prediction accuracies of both language models. Across 4 different public benchmark datasets of requirement engineering tasks, it compares performance of both language models with existing task specific machine/deep learning predictors and traditional language models. Specifically, the paper utilizes 4 benchmark datasets; Pure (7,445 samples, requirements extraction),PROMISE (622 samples, requirements classification), REQuestA (300 question answer (QA) pairs) and Aerospace datasets (6347 words, requirements NER tagging). Our experiments reveal that, in comparison to ChatGPT, Gemini requires more careful prompt engineering to provide accurate predictions. Moreover, across requirement extraction benchmark dataset the state-of-the-art F1-score is 0.86 while ChatGPT and Gemini achieved 0.76 and 0.77,respectively. The State-of-the-art F1-score on requirements classification dataset is 0.96 and both language models 0.78.

Many of these tools are provided as remote APIs. Using third-party APIs raises data privacy and security concerns for client companies, which motivates the use of locally-deployed language models. In this study, we explore the trade-off between model accuracy and energy consumption, aiming to provide valuable insights to help developers make informed decisions when selecting a language model. We investigate the performance of 18 families of LLMs in typical software development tasks on two real-world infrastructures, a commodity GPU and a powerful AI-specific GPU. Given that deploying LLMs locally requires powerful infrastructure which might not be affordable for everyone, we consider both full-precision and quantized models. Our findings reveal that employing a big LLM with a higher energy budget does not always translate to significantly improved accuracy. Additionally, quantized versions of large models generally offer better efficiency and accuracy compared to full-precision versions of medium-sized ones. Apart from that, not a single model is suitable for all types of software development tasks.",en,0,0,0,public,[]

Previous research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may help mitigate loneliness. However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs like ChatGPT is more prevalent--and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT, particularly those outside of its marketed use as task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22 times more likely to be targeted than men. Our findings underscore ethical and legal questions about this technology, and note risks like radicalisation or further isolation. We conclude with recommendations for research and industry to address loneliness.",en,0,3,0,public,[]

In this work, we make a first attempt to an exploration of impromptu euphemism detection and introduce the Impromptu Cybercrime Euphemisms Detection (ICED) dataset. Moreover, we propose a detection framework tailored to this problem, which employs context augmentation modeling and multi-round iterative training. Our detection framework mainly consists of a coarse-grained and a fine-grained classification model. The coarse-grained classification model removes most of the harmless content in the corpus to be detected. The fine-grained model, impromptu euphemisms detector, integrates context augmentation and multi-round iterations training to better predicts the actual meaning of a masked token. In addition, we leverage ChatGPT to evaluate the mode's capability.

This paper introduces a novel framework designed to autonomously evaluate the robustness of LLMs by incorporating refined adversarial prompts and domain-constrained knowledge guidelines in the form of knowledge graphs. Our method systematically generates descriptive sentences from domain-constrained knowledge graph triplets to formulate adversarial prompts, enhancing the relevance and challenge of the evaluation. These prompts, generated by the LLM itself and tailored to evaluate its own robustness, undergo a rigorous filtering and refinement process, ensuring that only those with high textual fluency and semantic fidelity are used. This self-evaluation mechanism allows the LLM to evaluate its robustness without the need for external benchmarks. We assess the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing on both proprietary models like ChatGPT and open-source models such as Llama-3.1, Phi-3, and Mistral. Results confirm that our approach not only reduces dependency on conventional data but also provides a targeted and efficient means of evaluating LLM robustness in constrained domains.",en,0,1,0,public,[]

While existing works demonstrate these models' vulnerability to deliberately placed adversarial texts, such texts are often easily identifiable as anomalous. In this paper, we present the first approach to generate scene-coherent typographic adversarial attacks that mislead advanced LVLMs while maintaining visual naturalness through the capability of the LLM-based agent. Our approach addresses three critical questions: what adversarial text to generate, where to place it within the scene, and how to integrate it seamlessly. We propose a training-free, multi-modal LLM-driven scene-coherent typographic adversarial planning (SceneTAP) that employs a three-stage process: scene understanding, adversarial planning, and seamless integration. The SceneTAP utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning to comprehend the scene, formulate effective adversarial text, strategically plan its placement, and provide detailed instructions for natural integration within the image. This is followed by a scene-coherent TextDiffuser that executes the attack using a local diffusion mechanism. We extend our method to real-world scenarios by printing and placing generated patches in physical environments, demonstrating its practical implications. Extensive experiments show that our scene-coherent adversarial text successfully misleads state-of-the-art LVLMs, including ChatGPT-4o, even after capturing new images of physical setups. Our evaluations demonstrate a significant increase in attack success rates while maintaining visual naturalness and contextual appropriateness. This work highlights vulnerabilities in current vision-language models to sophisticated, scene-coherent adversarial attacks and provides insights into potential defense mechanisms.",en,0,1,0,public,[]

113587127554818159,2024-12-03 05:00:06+00:00,"Ein Seelenstriptease vor der KI?2024 ist das Jahr, in dem die künstliche Intelligenz alltäglich wurde. Wir gewöhnten uns an die Präsenz der KI und die Möglichkeit, auch via Handy Fragen an ChatGPT oder eines der anderen Sprachmodelle zu richten. Das war im Jahr zuvor noch anders gewesen: Da herrschte noch eine gewisse Ehrfurcht. Und es kam uns (oder zumindest mir) falsch vor, diese unglaublich komplexen Systeme mit Banalitäten zu behelligen.Wie weit könnte, soll oder darf diese Vertrautheit gehen? Meine Antwort ist klar: Wir müssen die Möglichkeiten ausloten. Und zwar in alle Richtungen: Mit der Pirr-App entwickeln wir gemeinsam erotische Fantastereien. Auf But­ter­flies begeben wir uns in ein soziales Netzwerk, in dem sich Avatare tummeln, die wir nach unseren Vorstellungen erschaffen haben. Und die Dot-App (fürs iPhone) stellt uns einen Gefährten an die Seite, mit dem wir über unser Leben und die Ereignisse des Tages sprechen. Wie ein interaktives Tagebuch, das uns mit Fragen und Bemerkungen herausfordert.Mit dieser Dot-App habe ich eine interessante und unerwartete Beobachtung gemacht:  So spannend ich die Idee finde, so gross sind meine Widerstände, mich ihr anzuvertrauen. Ich habe sie kurz für einen Artikel für die «Sonntagszeitung» angetestet und wollte sie für eine ausführliche Besprechung im Blog intensiver nutzen. Doch irgendwie konnte ich mich nie dazu aufraffen, mich ihr ernsthaft zu öffnen.Eine Art Dialog mit sich selbstEin Plädoyer für die Selbstfürsorge.Eine Voraussetzung wäre das nicht: Die App überfällt uns nicht mit persönlichen Fragen, sondern geht behutsam ans Werk. Ich habe dem KI-Gegenüber bei unserer Vorstellung gesagt, dass ich Science-Fiction-Geschichten mag und mir auch schon überlegt habe, selbst eine zu schreiben. Es hat mit guten Nachfragen darauf reagiert: nicht zu persönlich, auf eine zugewandte Art.Mein Eindruck ist, dass das eine Form von Introspektion ermöglicht, die sonst eher schwierig zu erzielen ist. Natürlich können wir unseren Freundinnen, Bekannten und Kolleginnen Dinge erzählen, die uns beschäftigen. Doch dabei könnte uns das Gefühl beschleichen, dass man uns für egozentrisch hält. Bei der KI besteht diese Gefahr nicht: Die hat kein eigenes Leben, von dem sie uns vielleicht würde erzählen wollen. Wir können sie daher mit unseren eigenen Themen zutexten, als ob es kein Morgen gäbe.Kann man sich auch die schweren Lasten von der Seele reden?Nun wäre in dieser Situation interessant herauszufinden, ob das nicht nur auf einer unverfänglichen Ebene funktioniert, sondern auch dann, wenn wir die dicken Bretter bohren. Kann sie uns bei den existenziellen Fragen beraten oder sogar bei Lebenskrisen helfen? Von einem echten Notfall in diesem Bereich werde ich derzeit zum Glück verschont, aber ich habe dieses Jahr mit Entscheiden gerungen. Wäre es nicht toll, sich so etwas von der Seele zu reden, ohne Gefahr zu laufen, dass uns jemand seinen Rat aufdrängt oder auf eine zwischenmenschliche Weise «falsch» reagiert? Eine entsprechend trainierte KI könnte in so einer Situation tatsächlich helfen – und geduldig zuhören, selbst wenn sich unsere Gedanken im Kreis drehen und wir immer wieder beim gleichen Punkt anlangen.Doch eben, mir war nicht danach. Es gibt stichhaltige Gründe, keinen Seelenstriptease hinzulegen. Natürlich der Datenschutz: Wir wissen nicht, was der Betreiber der App mit sensiblen Informationen anstellt. Es ist auch nicht ausgeschlossen, dass die KI den Ton nicht trifft und eine Krise noch verschlimmert. Und die Frage lässt sich nicht wegdiskutieren, ob uns die App vom Gang zum Psychiater abhält, den wir eigentlich nötig hätten.Nur nichts überstürzenDaher kann ich an dieser Stelle leider nicht mit einem solide abgestützten Fazit zur Dot-App dienen. Falls ihr tiefer graben wollt: In den Einstellungen lässt sich bei Preferred Language auch Deutsch einstellen, sodass ihr nicht in Englisch mit ihr kommunizieren müsst. Und wenn ihr gewillt seit, Dot Zugriff auf euren Kalender zu gewähren, hat das KI-Gegenüber eine Ahnung von euren Aktivitäten und benutzt die als Aufhänger, um ein Gespräch in Gang zu bringen.Vielleicht werde ich noch einen Anlauf nehmen und über allfällige neue Erkenntnisse natürlich berichten. Festhalten lässt sich hier, dass diese Form von Mensch-Maschinen-Beziehung in den Kinderschuhen steckt. Sie hat Potenzial. Trotzdem ist es nicht schlecht, Zurückhaltung zu üben und in kleinen Schritten zu erkunden, wohin uns dieses Abenteuer führt …Beitragsbild: Er ist wenigstens ans Beichtgeheimnis gebunden (Cottonbro Studio, Pexels-Lizenz).#KI",de,0,0,0,public,"[{'name': 'ki', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/ki'}]"
113587118118146102,2024-12-03 04:57:53+00:00,"@crazyeddie @skinnylatte A generalized LLM like ChatGPT is actually pretty good at generating repetitive boilerplate code, the same kind of thing you'd do with a code template if you had one, only it can just take a text prompt and go. Of course, that's just step one, getting past the blank screen with fewer typos than a human would probably make. It's none of the hard parts of building a software product.But you still need enough knowledge to vet everything that comes out of it. If you ask it to, say, write some code to use a certain API to do something, and the API can't actually do that, it *will* just make up some bullshit that looks very convincingly like how the API would do it if it could. And that kind of thing can be maddeningly deceptive, especially if you're not wary of it.",en,0,0,0,public,[]

113585009986731030,2024-12-02 20:01:23+00:00,"„He, ChatGPT, das war meine Idee!“Heute war ich mit einem interessanten KI-Fail konfrontiert, den ich gerne für mich festhalten will. Hier kommt deshalb die Geschichte dazu:Morgen bin ich zu einem HRM Xmas Special in Leipzig eingeladen. Ich kenne die Zielgruppe nur sehr wenig. Eingeführt wurde ich, dass die Beteiligten wenig Erfahrungen zu Pädagogik mitbringen, aber interessiert daran wären, wohin die Bildung sich aktuell bewegt. Das soll ich in einem sehr knappen Impulsvortrag von rund 30 Minuten vorstellen.Für solch einen Vortrag bietet sich eine Thesenform an. Und weil die Veranstaltung ja ein ‚Xmas Special‘ sein soll, kam ich auf den (sehr naheliegenden) Gedanken, die für mich wichtigsten Thesen zu Bildung mit weihnachtlichen Metaphern zu erklären. Beispielsweise könnten Geschenke für die ‚Kultur des Teilens‘ stehen, das Plätzchenbacken dafür, dass Entwicklung wichtiger ist, als Vermittlung oder der Adventskalender dafür, dass es mehr Prozess- statt Ergebnisorientierung beim Lernen braucht … Diese ersten Ideen habe ich auch bei ChatGPT eingegeben und nach weiteren Ideen gefragt, die ich in meinem Vortrag verwenden könnte. Mein Prompt war also sinngemäß: Hier sind meine ersten Ideen: … Welche weihnachtlichen Metaphern eignen sich ansonsten für eine kollaborative, kreative und lernendenzentrierte Form von Bildung?Schon während ich diesen Prompt formulierte, blitzten in meinem Kopf weitere Ideen auf und ich dachte: ‚Soll ich das jetzt wirklich mit ChatGPT entwickeln oder überlege ich besser erst einmal selbst weiter?‘. Allerdings blieb ich dann bei meinem ursprünglichen Plan und dachte: ‚Es schadet ja nichts, mir von ChatGPT hier mal direkt ein paar Inspirationen zu holen ….‘Leider war die Antwort von ChatGPT dann direkt ziemlich perfekt bzw. in jedem Fall so gut, dass ich davon ganz viel fast schon direkt übernehmen hätte können. Genau deshalb geschah dann aber etwas Merkwürdiges: Anstatt mich zu freuen und die Antwort zu kopieren, wurde ich ärgerlich und unzufrieden. Ich dachte: ‚He, ChatGPT, das war meine Idee!! Du solltest das nicht für mich entwickeln, sondern mich nur dabei begleiten.‘ Hinter meinem Ärger stand die Erkenntnis, dass jetzt ja nicht mehr ich Urheberin war, sondern ChatGPT ‚meine‘ Ideen generiert hat. Dabei hätte ich das viel lieber selbst gemacht …Als Konsequenz habe ich den Chat dann geschlossen und doch erst einmal selbst überlegt. Mindestens 70 Prozent des Vortrags sind jetzt wirklich meines. Beim Rest waren die Vorschläge von ChatGPT zu passend, als dass ich sie hätte draußen lassen wollen.Ich finde: Eine sehr interessante und hilfreiche Erfahrung. Sie lehrt mich, dass es manches Mal in der Tat besser sein kann, ganz bewusst erst einmal selbst zu entwickeln, anstatt zu schnell bei einem KI-Sprachmodell nachzufragen.Heute Abend war ich dann bei einer Austauschrunde mit der IG Metall im Rahmen ihrer Digitalen Woche eingeladen, wo es auch um KI ging. Ich erzählte dort meine Geschichte. Ein Kollege gab daraufhin den aus meiner Sicht guten Hinweis, dass so etwas natürlich auch ein Gradmesser sein kann, um die eigene Kreativität auf den Prüfstand zu stellen. Denn in diesem Fall war es wahrscheinlich in der Tat so, dass meine Idee, die ich sehr cool fand, nicht wirklich kreativ war, weil weihnachtliche Metaphern im Internet überall kursieren und sehr verbreitet sind. Ich könnte mir also zukünftig auch die Herausforderung stellen, Ideen zu entwickeln, bei deren Ausarbeitung ein KI-Sprachmodell nur wenig hilfreich ist.    #Fail",de,0,0,0,public,"[{'name': 'fail', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/fail'}]"

113584216552334465,2024-12-02 16:40:00.671000+00:00,"En enero de 2021 Intel no estaba precisamente en su mejor momento. Bob Swan, nombrado CEO en 2019, no logró enderezar el camino, y dos años después el testigo lo cogía Pat Gelsinger, uno de los grandes veteranos de la empresa.La empresa se enfrentaba al mayor reto de su historia: TSMC se había convertido en el líder de la industria de los semiconductores y le había robado la cartera a Intel, pero Gelsinger parecía tener muy claro el camino y puso en marcha la estrategia IDM 2.0.En XatakaAsí se fabrican los procesadores Core de 13ª generación 'Raptor Lake': visitamos la fábrica de chips de Intel en IsraelEl foco de este exingeniero parecía prometedor: Intel volvería a a apostar muy fuerte por volver a convertirse en absoluto protagonista de este ámbito. La estrategia IDM 2.0 y la intención de ser un fabricante para todos —y no solo para ella misma— parecían desde luego decisiones acertadas.Los planes para crear esas nuevas plantas de fabricación en EEUU y Europa —para mitigar la dependencia de Asia— eran también llamativos. El gobierno de EEUU impulsó esos planes haciendo a Intel gran beneficiaria de su CHIPS Act. Gracias a dichas medidas, Intel recibiría 20.000 millones de dólares en préstamos y subvenciones para crear plantas de chips en EEUU.Perdiendo el tren de la IAPero todas esas medidas no acabaron de funcionas. A esos esfuerzos sin resultados se le añadió el hecho de que Intel había perdido el tren de la IA. El auge de ChatGPT convirtió a NVIDIA en la empresa de semiconductores más importante del planeta junto a TSMC: de repente Intel quedaba relegada a un segundo plano.El auge de TSMC primero y de NVIDIA después ha supuesto un cambio de escenario sorprendente. Intel, dueña y señora del mercado del PC durante más de cuatro décadas, se vio de repente superada por los acontecimientos, y a pesar de los esfuerzos de Gelsinger, nada parecía funcionar.Llegar tarde a la IA le salió especialmente caro a la empresa, que cayó de forma notable en valoración de mercado y que tomó medidas drásticas. Por ejemplo, el despido de más de 15.000 empleados este pasado verano o el aplazamiento e incluso la cancelación de los planes para construir algunas plantas de chips en Europa.Pero es que ni siquiera aquello que solía hacer bien salía bien. El avance en nuevos nodos fotolitográficos volvía a dar problemas, y la empresa, a pesar de generar buenas expectativas, no acababa de dar con la tecla. El nodo 20A acabó siendo cancelado para centrar el desarrollo del nodo 18A, y TSMC acabó convirtiéndose en un incómodo aliado.Es necesario un cambio de timónIntel ha lanzado sucesivas generaciones de chips durante el liderazgo de Gelsinger, pero los avances han sido menos llamativos de lo que apuntaban dichos chips. Meteor Lake, el que se suponía iba a ser el salto hacia delante más importante de Intel en los últimos 40 años, no ha acabado de cuajar como se esperaba.Las dificultades también afectaron a las subvenciones del programa 'Chips and Science Act' de Estados Unidos, pero aun así Intel sigue siendo la mayor beneficiada de dichas dotaciones.Las últimas noticias que han llegado no eran especialmente favorables tampoco. La empresa no fabricará los chips de la PS6 según fuentes cercanas al proyecto, y en estas horas bajas hasta se rumoreó recientemente que Qualcomm podría haber estado valorando comprar directamente Intel, aunque el interés de la empresa parece haberse difuminado.La dimisión de Pat Gelsinger —que, algunos apuntan, era inevitable— es aparentemente la aceptación de que las medidas elegidas por Gelsinger no estaban funcionando. La empresa ya busca a su sucesor, pero mientras tanto dos de sus altos directivos —David Zinsner y Michelle Johnston Holthaus— ocuparán el cargo de coCEO con Frank Yeary como director ejecutivo del consejo.A partir de aquí las incógnitas son tan enormes como los retos. TSMC y NVIDIA se han convertido en competidores formidables, pero Intel debería ser capaz de reaccionar y tratar de comenzar a enmendar el camino poco a poco.En XatakaLos SoC Intel Core Ultra 200S, explicados: estos son los chips con los que Intel espera reconquistar a los usuarios de PC¿Qué decisiones tomará Intel tanto en su estrategia IDM 2.0 como en IA? Es evidente que tiene que haber algún cambio: mantener el rumbo que estaban manteniendo con Gelsinger no tendría sentido tras su dimisión, y ahora queda por ver cuáles son las ideas que Intel plantea para su futuro.Dicen que un problema es una oportunidad de mejora. Si el problema es el mayor de tu historia, estamos también (quizás) ante la mayor oportunidad de mejora de la historia de Intel. ¿Logrará resurgir y volver a lo que un día fue? Lo veremos.En Xataka | TSMC mató a la oblea de 450 mm en la que cabían muchos más chips. Y gracias a eso ganó esa guerra -  La noticia       La dimisión de Pat Gelsinger colma el vaso de Intel.

113583132102613019,2024-12-02 12:04:26+00:00,"Verantwoord innoveren is het nieuwe normaalJan van Ginkel is loco-provinciesecretaris bij de provincie Zuid-Holland en veelgevraagd spreker over digitalisering. In eigen huis is hij volop bezig met de digitale transformatie. Verantwoord innoveren met AI en algoritmes is het nieuwe normaal, stelt hij. Wat het van hem vraagt als leider? “Ruimte geven, investeren, de goede mensen in huis hebben en bewust zelf ontwikkelen.”Bij bijna alles wat de provincie Zuid-Holland doet, speelt ICT een belangrijke rol. De inzet van algoritmes en AI horen daarbij. Van Ginkel geeft een voorbeeld: “De provincie is de beheerder van de wegen en vaarwegen. We zetten AI in om brugbedieners te ondersteunen het beste moment te kiezen voor een brugopening. Zo kunnen we de doorstroming verbeteren voor weggebruikers en de scheepvaart.” Van Ginkel benadrukt: “We gebruiken AI altijd om de maatschappelijke opgaven een stukje verder te brengen.” Bekijk de algoritmes van Zuid-Holland in het Algoritmeregister.Generatieve AIZuid-Holland zet ook AI en algoritmes in in de bedrijfsvoering. Zo werd in eigen huis PZH-assist ontwikkeld, een generatieve AI-toepassing. “Medewerkers kunnen die gebruiken om allerlei ChatGPT-achtige vragen te stellen.” Het was een bewuste keuze om de oplossing zelf te ontwikkelen: “Als je aan commerciële AI-tools een document aanbiedt met de prompt ‘maak een samenvatting’, dan kunnen de Googles van deze wereld meelezen. Onze eigen versie draait in een eigen omgeving en is volstrekt veilig. Ook ontwikkelen we nu toepassingen waarbij via een chatbot onze eigen data bevraagd kan worden, bijvoorbeeld een chatbot die vragen kan beantwoorden over onze verlof en IKB regelingen.” PZH Assist staat alvast vol in de belangstelling: “Er is inmiddels een community van mensen die dit naar hun eigen organisatie willen vertalen en daar implementeren. We delen onze oplossingen graag, het is immers al betaald met publiek geld.” Meer over PZH Assist.  “Transparantie, betrouwbaarheid en democratische rechten zijn voor ons hoge waarden”Jan van Ginkel&nbsp; loco-provinciesecretaris Provincie Zuid-Holland Nieuw normaalVerantwoord innoveren is voor Van Ginkel vanzelfsprekend. “Wij zijn een overheidsorganisatie, dus transparantie, betrouwbaarheid en democratische rechten zijn voor ons belangrijke waarden.” Wel geeft hij aan dat provincies vooral geodata gebruiken. “Bij het verwerken van persoonsdata telt privacy en ethiek zwaarder. De moreel-ethische kant nemen we bloedserieus, maar we kunnen veel ontwikkelen zonder persoonsgegevens.” Zuid-Holland waarborgt de ethische kant op verschillende manieren. “Een team met ethici is voortdurend in gesprek met de organisatie om bewustwording, belang en de vaardigheden te helpen ontwikkelen. Verantwoord innoveren is het nieuwe normaal waar ik naartoe wil.”IAMANatuurlijk komen daar ook dilemma’s bij kijken. “Daar doen we sessies voor, zoals IAMA’s.” Dataminimalisatie is bij de provincie een belangrijk uitgangpunt, vertelt Van Ginkel. “Altijd is de vraag: hoe kun je met zo min mogelijk data een goede oplossing creëren? Bijvoorbeeld: op welk detailniveau koop je geodata in? Bij een te hoog detailniveau wordt die informatie wellicht toch privacygevoelig. Of: als ik een algoritme maak om de brugbediening te optimaliseren, moet ik toch wat informatie verzamelen over schepen en weggebruikers. Maar ik hoef niet te weten of de schipper Piet of Jan heet.” Gespreksmiddel met politiek Zuid-Holland ontwikkelt een monitor van wat er in Zuid-Holland gebeurt in de digitale transformatie. Die monitor dient als gespreksmiddel voor Provinciale Staten. Voor bewustwording, kennisopbouw en om richting te krijgen.  Zelf kennis opbouwenHoe stuurt Van Ginkel op verantwoorde inzet van algoritmes en AI? “Ruimte geven, erin investeren, de goede mensen in huis hebben, maar ook bewust zelf ontwikkelen.” Dat laatste was een bewuste keuze bij de ontwikkeling van PZH-Assist: “We willen dat onze medewerkers snappen hoe generatieve AI werkt. Kunnen we dat bijvoorbeeld zelf programmeren? Ja, dat kunnen we, zo blijkt.” Kennis is belangrijk. “Wil je mee kunnen doen in de digitale transformatie, kun je niet alles uitbesteden of regie doen: je moet zelf kennis opbouwen. Daar wil ik in investeren.” De kennis over de kracht van data en van algoritmes moet voor hem dan ook niet beperkt blijven tot de technici. Van Ginkel: “Begrijpen dat de wereld van data en algoritmes inmiddels een dominante wereld is die rechtstreeks elke functie van de overheid raakt, en dat bewustzijn omzetten in kennis en handelen, is voor de overheid de grootste opgave, denk ik.”Opschaalbare oplossingenVan Ginkel is trots dat de provincie veel zelf ontwikkelt. “Waar we het niet zelf kunnen doen, werken we samen met een netwerk van startups en universiteiten. En we hebben met 4 andere provincies het initiatief genomen 8 top-trainees op AI-gebied aan te trekken. Zij gaan ons 5en helpen om een aantal maatschappelijke opgaven verder te brengen en te zorgen dat die oplossingen opschaalbaar zijn (door anderen te gebruiken, red.).” Dat blijft een lastig vraagstuk, vertelt hij: “Als wij iets maken rond woningbouw en infrastructuur met AI, dat is dat vaak niet direct door anderen te gebruiken. De definitie van een woning in Flevoland is misschien anders dan bij ons.” Die vertaalslag wil hij nu ook automatiseren. “Ik probeer de opschaling onderdeel te laten zijn van de algoritmische oplossing.”   “Ik probeer de opschaling onderdeel te laten zijn van de algoritmische oplossing”  Principieel relevantDe provincie Zuid-Holland was een van de voorlopers bij het ontstaan van het Algoritmeregister. Van Ginkel draagt het register dan ook een warm hart toe, maar plaatst er ook een kritische kanttekening bij. “Ik zei eerder al: De overheid moet betrouwbaar zijn, enzovoort. Dan is het logisch dat je transparant bent over de algoritmes die je inzet. Ik vind dat principieel relevant, dan moet je dat in handelen omzetten. Een algoritmeregister is een van de manieren waarop dat kan.” Het levert de organisatie ook wat op, vertelt hij: “We verwijzen burgers, bedrijven en instellingen ernaar om te laten zien: zo doen wij de dingen.”Hij wil tegelijkertijd ook een kanttekening plaatsen. “Het aantal algoritmes neemt exponentieel toe: vandaag komen er 10 bij, morgen 100 en overmorgen 1000. Het register wordt grotendeels handmatig gevuld. Mijn kritische vraag is: hoe houdbaar is zo’n algoritmeregister dan? Als je zegt: het register is vooral bedoeld om organisaties bewust te houden en transparant te zijn naar burgers, dan snap ik het. Maar als je wilt dat het register compleet is, is dat op den duur zo niet doenlijk. Als je tegenwoordig een boekhoudpakket koopt, zitten daar ook algoritmes in. Ik heb hier zelf nog geen oplossing voor.” Zijn conclusie: “Ik draag het algoritmeregister van harte, maar er zit ook iets naïefs in.”Samen innoverenWat hij andere bestuurders wil aanraden? “Mijn oproep is: laten we interdepartementaal en interbestuurlijk met veel meer tempo en kracht aan de slag gaan. Samen innoveren. Om dwars door alle overheidsorganisaties heen resultaten te boeken in maatschappelijke opgaven. Het probleem met netcongestie (overbelasting van het energienetwerk, red.) bijvoorbeeld raakt het rijk, raakt gemeentes, raakt de waterschappen, raakt de markt… Als we nou met elkaar zeggen: hier gaan wij niet 8, maar 80 AI-trainees opzetten?”Meer weten over hoe de provincie verantwoord AI en Algoritmes gebruikt?

Verantwoord innoveren is het nieuwe normaal waar ik naartoe wil.”IAMANatuurlijk komen daar ook dilemma’s bij kijken. “Daar doen we sessies voor, zoals IAMA’s.” Dataminimalisatie is bij de provincie een belangrijk uitgangpunt, vertelt Van Ginkel. “Altijd is de vraag: hoe kun je met zo min mogelijk data een goede oplossing creëren? Bijvoorbeeld: op welk detailniveau koop je geodata in? Bij een te hoog detailniveau wordt die informatie wellicht toch privacygevoelig. Of: als ik een algoritme maak om de brugbediening te optimaliseren, moet ik toch wat informatie verzamelen over schepen en weggebruikers. Maar ik hoef niet te weten of de schipper Piet of Jan heet.” Gespreksmiddel met politiek Zuid-Holland ontwikkelt een monitor van wat er in Zuid-Holland gebeurt in de digitale transformatie. Die monitor dient als gespreksmiddel voor Provinciale Staten. Voor bewustwording, kennisopbouw en om richting te krijgen.  Zelf kennis opbouwenHoe stuurt Van Ginkel op verantwoorde inzet van algoritmes en AI? “Ruimte geven, erin investeren, de goede mensen in huis hebben, maar ook bewust zelf ontwikkelen.” Dat laatste was een bewuste keuze bij de ontwikkeling van PZH-Assist: “We willen dat onze medewerkers snappen hoe generatieve AI werkt. Kunnen we dat bijvoorbeeld zelf programmeren? Ja, dat kunnen we, zo blijkt.” Kennis is belangrijk. “Wil je mee kunnen doen in de digitale transformatie, kun je niet alles uitbesteden of regie doen: je moet zelf kennis opbouwen. Daar wil ik in investeren.” De kennis over de kracht van data en van algoritmes moet voor hem dan ook niet beperkt blijven tot de technici. Van Ginkel: “Begrijpen dat de wereld van data en algoritmes inmiddels een dominante wereld is die rechtstreeks elke functie van de overheid raakt, en dat bewustzijn omzetten in kennis en handelen, is voor de overheid de grootste opgave, denk ik.”Opschaalbare oplossingenVan Ginkel is trots dat de provincie veel zelf ontwikkelt. “Waar we het niet zelf kunnen doen, werken we samen met een netwerk van startups en universiteiten. En we hebben met 4 andere provincies het initiatief genomen 8 top-trainees op AI-gebied aan te trekken. Zij gaan ons 5en helpen om een aantal maatschappelijke opgaven verder te brengen en te zorgen dat die oplossingen opschaalbaar zijn (door anderen te gebruiken, red.).” Dat blijft een lastig vraagstuk, vertelt hij: “Als wij iets maken rond woningbouw en infrastructuur met AI, dat is dat vaak niet direct door anderen te gebruiken. De definitie van een woning in Flevoland is misschien anders dan bij ons.” Die vertaalslag wil hij nu ook automatiseren. “Ik probeer de opschaling onderdeel te laten zijn van de algoritmische oplossing.”   “Ik probeer de opschaling onderdeel te laten zijn van de algoritmische oplossing”  Principieel relevantDe provincie Zuid-Holland was een van de voorlopers bij het ontstaan van het Algoritmeregister. Van Ginkel draagt het register dan ook een warm hart toe, maar plaatst er ook een kritische kanttekening bij. “Ik zei eerder al: De overheid moet betrouwbaar zijn, enzovoort. Dan is het logisch dat je transparant bent over de algoritmes die je inzet. Ik vind dat principieel relevant, dan moet je dat in handelen omzetten. Een algoritmeregister is een van de manieren waarop dat kan.” Het levert de organisatie ook wat op, vertelt hij: “We verwijzen burgers, bedrijven en instellingen ernaar om te laten zien: zo doen wij de dingen.”Hij wil tegelijkertijd ook een kanttekening plaatsen. “Het aantal algoritmes neemt exponentieel toe: vandaag komen er 10 bij, morgen 100 en overmorgen 1000. Het register wordt grotendeels handmatig gevuld. Mijn kritische vraag is: hoe houdbaar is zo’n algoritmeregister dan? Als je zegt: het register is vooral bedoeld om organisaties bewust te houden en transparant te zijn naar burgers, dan snap ik het. Maar als je wilt dat het register compleet is, is dat op den duur zo niet doenlijk. Als je tegenwoordig een boekhoudpakket koopt, zitten daar ook algoritmes in. Ik heb hier zelf nog geen oplossing voor.” Zijn conclusie: “Ik draag het algoritmeregister van harte, maar er zit ook iets naïefs in.”Samen innoverenWat hij andere bestuurders wil aanraden? “Mijn oproep is: laten we interdepartementaal en interbestuurlijk met veel meer tempo en kracht aan de slag gaan. Samen innoveren. Om dwars door alle overheidsorganisaties heen resultaten te boeken in maatschappelijke opgaven. Het probleem met netcongestie (overbelasting van het energienetwerk, red.) bijvoorbeeld raakt het rijk, raakt gemeentes, raakt de waterschappen, raakt de markt… Als we nou met elkaar zeggen: hier gaan wij niet 8, maar 80 AI-trainees opzetten?”Meer weten over hoe de provincie verantwoord AI en Algoritmes gebruikt?

113582737182234545,2024-12-02 10:23:47.459000+00:00,"La empresa de Sam Altman está en plena transformación: tras crear el chatbot más famoso del mundo y redefinir el término ""IA"" para todo un planeta, ahora aspira a convertirse en un verdadero gigante tecnológico global.Por qué es importante. Tras conseguir hace unas semanas el hito de la valoración de 150.000 millones de dólares, su ambición de cara a 2025 es alcanzar los 1.000 millones de usuarios. Ese salto la llevaría a la liga de Google o Meta.En cifras:6.600 millones de dólares conseguidos en su última ronda de financiación.250 millones de usuarios activos semanales.Más de 5.000 millones de dólares de pérdidas anuales.2.000 empleados (hace un año eran unos 400).En XatakaEl nuevo gran modelo de OpenAI  apunta a algo preocupante: una desaceleración de la IA La panorámica. OpenAI está construyendo su propia red de centros de datos en Estados Unidos, desarrollando su motor de búsqueda basado en IA –de momento en una fase casi embrionaria– y preparando el lanzamiento de sus agentes IA preparados para realizar tareas online complejas.Es una estrategia que recuerda mucho, con el contexto tecnológico de otra época, a los primeros años de Google.Entre bambalinas. Es un giro importante. OpenAI nació como un laboratorio de investigación sin ánimo de lucro. Ahora, bajo el liderazgo de Altman, se está transformando en una máquina comercial que quiere competir de verdad con los gigantes de la tecnología.""Estamos en una fase de crecimiento masivo"", ha dicho Sarah Friar, directora financiera de OpenAI, al Financial Times. ""Necesitamos estar en la frontera en cuanto a modelos de IA. Y eso es caro"".El punto de inflexión. La alianza con Apple va ganando tintes de convertirse en un hito decisivo para la empresa. Integrar ChatGPT en los más de 2.000 millones de iPhone que hay en el mundo es algo que llevará tiempo por los plazos que maneja la llegada de Apple Intelligence.Eso sí, cuando ocurra, será la mejor puerta a conseguir ese objetivo de los 1.000 millones de usuarios.Sí, pero. No es un camino fácil. OpenAI está asumiendo más de 8.000 millones de dólares en pérdidas anuales, según reveló The New York Times, y sigue lejos de alcanzar el break even (punto de equilibrio en el que los ingresos igualan a los gastos).Además, se está enfrentando a una demanda de su antiguo socio, Elon Musk, quien busca anular su acuerdo comercial con Microsoft.OpenAI está haciendo all in a convertirse en la gran puerta de entrada a la información en la era de la IA.Esta transformación puede cambiar el panorama tecnológico mundial... o comerse todos sus recursos por el camino.Imagen destacada | Xataka con MidjourneyEn Xataka | Ya sabemos cuánto cobró Sam Altman por ser CEO de OpenAI en 2023: ""el mínimo para tener el seguro médico"" -  La noticia       OpenAI ya no quiere ser solo ChatGPT: quiere ser la próxima Google        fue publicada originalmente en       Xataka             por        Javier Lacort            . https://www.xataka.com/empresas-y-economia/openai-no-quiere-ser-solo-chatgpt-quiere-ser-proxima-google#Noticias #Xataka #XatakaEspaña #España #Periodismo #BonitoBot #Bot #RSS #RSSBot",,0,0,0,public,"[{'name': 'noticias', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/noticias'}, {'name': 'xataka', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/xataka'}, {'name': 'xatakaespana', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/xatakaespana'}, {'name': 'espana', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/espana'}, {'name': 'periodismo', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/periodismo'}, {'name': 'bonitobot', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/bonitobot'}, {'name': 'bot', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/bot'}, {'name': 'rss', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/rss'}, {'name': 'rssbot', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/rssbot'}]"

Vamos a decirte cómo hacer este sorteo con ChatGPT, Copilot y Gemini, con un método que te va a servir para todos ellos.Vamos a empezar diciéndote las ventajas y desventajas que tiene usar este método para el sorteo, porque hay algunas cosas importantes que debes tener en cuenta. No es todo tan fácil como parece. Y luego, te diremos el prompt que puedes utilizar con cualquiera de estas IA y la manera en la que puedes adaptarlo.Pros y contras del amigo invisible con IAHacer el sorteo con inteligencia artificial tiene un importante punto negativo, y es que siempre habrá una persona que sepa TODOS los resultados. Así como hay páginas donde todo se sortea de forma anónima sin que nadie sepa quién le ha tocado a quién, en este caso tendrá que haber una persona voluntaria de escribir el prompt, ver los emparejamientos e ir comunicándolos.Por lo tanto, este método va a eliminar el factor de completa sorpresa, aunque se va a poder mantener en cierto modo si la persona responsable es capaz de repartir los resultados manteniendo el secreto.La parte positiva es la privacidad. Al hacer el amigo invisible de esta manera no necesitas entregar tus datos y los de tus amigos a páginas en las que no sabes qué se va a hacer con ellos. No es que todas las páginas de amigo invisible vayan a vender tus datos, pero siempre puede haber alguna que lo haga.Evidentemente, al hacer esto habrá datos que tendrá que saber luego la persona que organice el sorteo para decir los resultados. Por ejemplo, tendrás que darle un teléfono o correo electrónico a esta persona para que a cada uno le diga a quién debe realizarle el regalo.En XatakaChatGPT, Copilot y Gemini vs Google: comparativa entre buscador e inteligencia artificial para encontrar cosas en Internet Amigo invisible con ChatGPT, Copilot y GeminiPara hacer el sorteo del amigo invisible con inteligencia artificial, vas a necesitar escribir un prompt un poco largo, pero en el que se especifiquen todos los detalles. Para empezar, en este prompt vas a tener que incluir los nombres de las personas que participan.Aunque es opcional, después de especificar los nombres conviene mencionar las excepciones que deben aplicarse al sorteo. Por ejemplo, si participan parejas puedes decirle a la IA que no se toquen entre ellas.El prompt que he utilizado es el siguiente:Quiero organizar un sorteo del amigo invisible. Estas son las personas que participan: Loki, Freya, Herminio, Faustina, Clemencio, Cayetana.Loki no puede tocarle a Freya ni Freya a Loki. además, Faustina y Clemencio tampoco pueden tocarse entre ellos. Teniendo en cuenta estas excepciones, organiza el sorteo del amigo invisible.Como has visto, en el prompt primero hemos dicho los nombres, y luego le hemos dado las excepciones. El tema de no regalarse entre sí lo hemos hecho de dos maneras diferentes para que veas dos formas de hacerlo, las dos funcionan. Puedes personalizar los nombres y excepciones según tus necesidades.Este prompt te sirve para cualquier IA,. Solo con mencionar que se trata del amigo invisible la inteligencia artificial ya sabrá cómo proceder usando los nombres, y también entendenderá todas las excepciones que le des.En Xataka Basics | Cómo iniciarse en la inteligencia artificial desde cero: conceptos básicos, herramientas, trucos y consejos -  La noticia       Amigo invisible 2024 con ChatGPT, Gemini o Copilot: cómo hacer el sorteo usando inteligencia artificial        fue publicada originalmente en       Xataka             por        Yúbal Fernández            . https://www.xataka.com/basics/amigo-invisible-2024-chatgpt-gemini-copilot-como-hacer-sorteo-usando-inteligencia-artificial#Noticias #Xataka #XatakaEspaña #España #Periodismo #BonitoBot #Bot #RSS #RSSBot",,0,0,0,public,"[{'name': 'noticias', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/noticias'}, {'name': 'xataka', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/xataka'}, {'name': 'xatakaespana', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/xatakaespana'}, {'name': 'espana', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/espana'}, {'name': 'periodismo', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/periodismo'}, {'name': 'bonitobot', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/bonitobot'}, {'name': 'bot', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/bot'}, {'name': 'rss', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/rss'}, {'name': 'rssbot', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/rssbot'}]"

Rooted in Christopher Alexander's theory of centers, this work builds on the idea that all environments possess, to varying degrees, an innate sense of life. Alexander identified 15 fundamental properties, such as levels of scale and thick boundaries, that characterize living structure, which Beautimeter uses as a basis for its analysis. By integrating GPT's advanced natural language processing capabilities, Beautimeter assesses the extent to which a structure embodies these 15 properties, enabling a nuanced evaluation of architectural and urban aesthetics. Using ChatGPT, the tool helps users generate insights into the perceived beauty and coherence of spaces. We conducted a series of case studies, evaluating images of architectural and urban environments, as well as carpets, paintings, and other artifacts. The results demonstrate Beautimeter's effectiveness in analyzing aesthetic qualities across diverse contexts. Our findings suggest that by leveraging GPT technology, Beautimeter offers architects, urban planners, and designers a powerful tool to create spaces that resonate deeply with people. This paper also explores the implications of such technology for architecture and urban design, highlighting its potential to enhance both the design process and the assessment of built environments.

This paper provides a systematic literature review focused on leveraging LLMs to generate explanations for recommendations -- a critical aspect for fostering transparency and user trust. We conducted a comprehensive search within the ACM Guide to Computing Literature, covering publications from the launch of ChatGPT (November 2022) to the present (November 2024). Our search yielded 232 articles, but after applying inclusion criteria, only six were identified as directly addressing the use of LLMs in explaining recommendations. This scarcity highlights that, despite the rise of LLMs, their application in explainable recommender systems is still in an early stage. We analyze these select studies to understand current methodologies, identify challenges, and suggest directions for future research.

This pilot study focuses on specializing ChatGPT behavior through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the OpenAI custom GPTs feature. The purpose of our chatbot, called Unimib Assistant, is to provide information and solutions to the specific needs of University of Milano-Bicocca (Unimib) students through a question-answering approach. We provided the system with a prompt highlighting its specific purpose and behavior, as well as university-related documents and links obtained from an initial need-finding phase, interviewing six students. After a preliminary customization phase, a qualitative usability test was conducted with six other students to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot, with the goal of improving it in a subsequent redesign phase. While the chatbot was appreciated for its user-friendly experience, perceived general reliability, well-structured responses, and conversational tone, several significant technical and functional limitations emerged. In particular, the satisfaction and overall experience of the users was impaired by the system's inability to always provide fully accurate information. Moreover, it would often neglect to report relevant information even if present in the materials uploaded and prompt given. Furthermore, it sometimes generated unclickable links, undermining its trustworthiness, since providing the source of information was an important aspect for our users. Further in-depth studies and feedback from other users as well as implementation iterations are planned to refine our Unimib Assistant.",en,0,2,0,public,[]

Our goal is to gain insights into the widespread use of LLMs among secondary students to inform their future development. Despite school restrictions, our survey of over 300 middle and high school students revealed that a remarkable 70% of students have utilized LLMs, higher than the usage percentage among young adults, and this percentage remains consistent across 7th to 12th grade. Students also reported using LLMs for multiple subjects, including language arts, history, and math assignments, but expressed mixed thoughts on their effectiveness due to occasional hallucinations in historical contexts and incorrect answers for lack of rigorous reasoning. The survey feedback called for LLMs better adapted for students, and also raised questions to developers and educators on how to help students from underserved communities leverage LLMs' capabilities for equal access to advanced education resources. We propose a few ideas to address such issues, including subject-specific models, personalized learning, and AI classrooms.",en,0,1,0,public,[]

Two powerful software, viz., CiteSpace and VOSviewer, were used to generate mapping visualizations of the intellectual landscape, trending issues and (re)emerging hotspots. The results indicate that in the 1980s and 1990s, linguistics and AI research was not robust, characterized by unstable publication over time. It has, however, witnessed a remarkable increase of publication since then, reaching 1478 articles in 2023, and 546 articles in January-March timespan in 2024, involving emerging issues and hotspots, addressing new horizons, new topics, and launching new applications and powerful deep learning language models including ChatGPT.",en,0,0,0,public,[]

In SimCMF, we conduct a thorough analysis of different basic components from the most naive design and ultimately propose a novel cross-modal alignment module to address the modality misalignment problem. We apply SimCMF to a representative vision foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM) to support any evaluated new imaging modality. Given the absence of relevant benchmarks, we construct a benchmark for performance evaluation. Our experiments confirm the intriguing potential of transferring vision foundation models in enhancing other sensors' performance. SimCMF can improve the segmentation performance (mIoU) from 22.15% to 53.88% on average for evaluated modalities and consistently outperforms other baselines.

This paper introduces SmartLLMSentry, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT with in-context training, to advance smart contract vulnerability detection. Traditional rule-based frameworks have limitations in integrating new detection rules efficiently. In contrast, SmartLLMSentry utilizes LLMs to streamline this process. We created a specialized dataset of five randomly selected vulnerabilities for model training and evaluation. Our results show an exact match accuracy of 91.1% with sufficient data, although GPT-4 demonstrated reduced performance compared to GPT-3 in rule generation. This study illustrates that SmartLLMSentry significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of vulnerability detection through LLMdriven rule integration, offering a new approach to improving Blockchain security and addressing previously underexplored vulnerabilities in smart contracts.",en,0,1,0,public,[]

यह उस विनम्र मित्र की तरह है जो पूरी कहानी के बजाय 'संक्षिप्त सारांश' पेश करके आपको यथासंभव धीरे से निराश करने का प्रयास करता है। इस दर पर, इमोजी और हाइकू में संचार करने वाले बड़े भाषा मॉडल (एलएलएम) के दिन काफी करीब आ सकते हैं।      प्रभावी रूप से, जहां एक बार आप दर्शन के इतिहास के बारे में पूछ सकते थे और एक शोध प्रबंध प्राप्त कर सकते थे, अब आपको मिलता है: “प्लेटो ने कुछ बातें कही हैं। अरस्तू असहमत थे. नीत्शे पर जाएँ. अंत।”      तो, हमारे वाचाल एआई चैटबॉट के मजबूत और मूक प्रकार बनने का क्या कारण है? न केवल इनपुट में, बल्कि, अधिक महत्वपूर्ण बात, आउटपुट में, टोकन की संख्या पर नई अजीब तरह से लगाई गई (अघोषित) सीमाएं हैं।      प्रत्येक टोकन की कम्प्यूटेशनल शक्ति खर्च होती है, और जब लाखों उपयोगकर्ता “जीवन का अर्थ क्या है?” से लेकर “मेरी बिल्ली मुझे अनदेखा क्यों करती है?” तक सब कुछ पूछ रहे हैं। ये लागतें एक किशोर के टेक्स्ट संदेशों की तुलना में तेजी से बढ़ती हैं।      वास्तविक रूप से, एक GPT-4 क्वेरी एक छोटे एलईडी बल्ब को एक घंटे तक बिजली देने के लिए पर्याप्त बिजली की खपत करती है। इसे लाखों उपयोगकर्ताओं से गुणा करें, और आप एक बिजली बिल देख रहे हैं जो एक बिटकॉइन खनिक को शरमा देगा।      अपने खजाने को खाली किए बिना या हमसे सीधे शुल्क लिए बिना आभासी रोशनी चालू रखने के लिए, एआई कंपनियां वसा को कम करती हैं और 'गुणवत्ता वाली कैलोरी' में कटौती करती हैं। यह सिकुड़न मुद्रास्फीति एक स्टॉप-गैप हो सकती है, हमसे एकमुश्त शुल्क लिए बिना बही-खाते को संतुलित करने का एक तरीका हो सकता है। लेकिन मुझे संदेह है कि हम जल्द ही मूल्य निर्धारण मॉडल देखेंगे जो इस पर आधारित होगा कि आपको वास्तव में कितनी जानकारी की आवश्यकता है।      एक सरल उत्तर?

Over the January-October period this year, the amount totalled $2.2 billion.Meanwhile, South Korea's exports extended on-year gains to the 14th straight month in November, on the back of the strong performance of chips.Outbound shipments rose 1.4 per cent from a year earlier to $56.3 billion last month, according to the data compiled by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.Source: IANShttps://www.socialnews.xyz/2024/12/01/south-korea-to-boost-export-of-cooling-equipment-for-data-centres-amid-ai-boom/",en,0,1,0,public,[]

We hope that despite the unfortunate last hour, everyone was having a good time overall.About that last hour: We want to clarify, that we were not DoSed ""within the game"". Up until the very last moment we were quite firmly in control of what was happening within the games network. Unfortunately, at about 21:17 UTC someone decided that the fun was going to end prematurely by launching a DDoS attack on our vpn endpoint from the public internet. By doing so, the attacker used up almost all of the bandwidth Hetzner made available for this machine and therefore the performance within the game network went to shambles, making the game pretty much unplayable. We will perform a thorough investigation on this attack and make sure to keep you updated about what we find.To provide some closure at least on your end, we have decided to discard anything that happened after tick 211 (21:17 UTC) from our score calculation, essentially like the game was supposed to end after that round. The results are now available on the https://ctf.saarland/static/scoreboard.An especially big congratulations to C4T But S4D, Bushwhackers, and KuK Hofhackerei for achieving the top three places.Please make sure to rate the event on https://ctftime.org/event/2490 and fill out our feedback form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeUuajbLpScJ-Za6ElGc7S-xeuedy5a4ODCC-LOLArbacZfjA/viewform.ChatGPT's humoristic interpretation of that situation:",en,0,2,0,public,"[{'name': 'saarctf', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/saarctf'}]"

क्या ये परिवर्तनीय नीतियां हैं जिन्हें आसानी से स्वैप और अपडेट किया जा सकता है? चैटजीपीटी ने डेविड मेयर पर कौन सा निजी डेटा प्राप्त किया और यह कैसे हुआ?” उसने आगे पूछा. दिलचस्प बात यह है कि मार्सेल सैमिन नामक एक अन्य उपयोगकर्ता ने बताया कि चैटजीपीटी अपने एपीआई के माध्यम से डेविड मेयर को आसानी से कहने में सक्षम था।यह एलएलएम स्तर पर नहीं बल्कि चैटजीपीटी द्वारा जोड़ी गई सत्यापन परत पर है।एपीआई के माध्यम से यह पूरी तरह से काम करता है।तो OpenAI में किसी ने मॉडरेशन नीति में “डेविड मेयर” को एक बड़ा लाल झंडा दिया।ज़ोर-ज़ोर से हंसना https://t.co/uHsBWLKj3O pic.twitter.com/3uqX2XlmsL– मार्सेल सैमिन (@marcelsamyn) 30 नवंबर 2024“यह एलएलएम स्तर पर नहीं है बल्कि चैटजीपीटी द्वारा जोड़ी गई सत्यापन परत पर है। एपीआई के माध्यम से यह पूरी तरह से काम करता है। इसलिए ओपनएआई में किसी ने “डेविड मेयर” को मॉडरेशन नीति में एक बड़ा लाल झंडा दिया,” उन्होंने अनुमान लगाया।                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Source link   Share this: FacebookX   #ओपनएआई #चटजपट_ #चटजपटबग #चटसपटडवडमयरकयनहकहसकत_ #डवडमयर #डवडमयरचटजपटबग",en,0,0,0,public,"[{'name': 'ओपनएआई', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/%E0%A4%93%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%8F%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%88'}, {'name': 'चटजपट_', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%9F_'}, {'name': 'चटजपटबग', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%97'}, {'name': 'चटसपटडवडमयरकयनहकहसकत_', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%A4_'}, {'name': 'डवडमयर', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B0'}, {'name': 'डवडमयरचटजपटबग', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%97'}]"

Here are a few speculative scenarios, depending on the lens you choose to view it through:Scientific PossibilitiesAstrophysical EventsAsteroid Impact: A massive asteroid could strike Earth, similar to what likely ended the dinosaurs.Solar Expansion: In a few billion years, the Sun will expand into a red giant, engulfing the inner planets, including Earth.Human-Caused CatastrophesNuclear War: A global conflict could devastate humanity and the environment.Climate Change: Severe environmental collapse could make Earth uninhabitable.Artificial Intelligence: Advanced AI, if misaligned with human values, could lead to unforeseen consequences.Cosmic EventsGamma Ray Burst: A burst from a distant star could fry Earth's atmosphere.Heat Death of the Universe: Eventually, the universe itself might ""end,"" reaching a state of maximum entropy.Philosophical ViewsExistentialism: The end of the world might be less important than how we live now.Religious Beliefs: Many traditions have their own visions of an apocalyptic end, whether through divine intervention or renewal.Pop Culture and FictionFrom zombie apocalypses to alien invasions, our imaginations have explored countless endings—but they’re often mirrors reflecting our anxieties or hopes.What’s your take? An optimistic twist or a dystopian vision? 😊",en,0,0,0,public,[]

Despite this, many people are using LLMs to answer basic questions such as ‘what is one plus one’, ‘what day is it’, and ‘what is the weather’. According to the IET, rudimentary online search should be used for these basic questions, with AI tools better suited to more complex tasks such as helping people write emails.""The above implies that these simple requests take an average amount of processing, but in fact simple requests to an LLM are far less resource-intensive.https://chatgpt.com/share/674b311b-3630-800f-b58b-5f8e4e39ac5eAlso, for complex questions, a single LLM request might replace a large number of search engine requests.  It's hard to say how many on average, but certainly ""more.""And of course if the user gets the info in a usable form within seconds, that impacts productivity, which translates into less PC time, less workplace utility time, less commute time, etc. per request.And then we should consider that this is fairly new tech, with hardware and algorithms that optimize resource consumption still in the early stages of development,  and much improvement no doubt still to come.So of course it's a concern, but it's hard to evaluate how much of one at such an early stage and with a tech that has such a multiplicity of both good and bad effects.",en,1,2,0,public,[]

Juni 2025 gilt in Deutschland das Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz (BFSG), das die 2019 verabschiedete EU-Richtlinie European Accessibility Act umsetzt.Das BFSG verpflichtet erstmals auch die Privatwirtschaft, mit Ausnahme von zum Beispiel kleinen Dienstleistungsbetrieben oder interaktiven Lernplattformen, zur digitalen Barrierefreiheit. Einer solchen Verpflichtung unterliegen Behörden schon seit 2020. Die „Aktion Mensch“ begrüßt das Gesetz als einen „wichtigen Baustein auf dem Weg zu einer inklusiveren digitalen Gesellschaft“. Bislang erfüllen nur die wenigsten Anbieter die Vorgaben des BFSG.Das Gesetz regelt unter anderem den Aufbau von Webshops, Kontaktformularen und Terminbuchungsmasken. Außerdem werden Seitenbetreiber verpflichtet, eine „Erklärung zur Barrierefreiheit“ zu veröffentlichen, die selbst ohne Hürden zugänglich ist und Informationen bereithält, wie die Betreiber:innen die Barrierefreiheit auf der Webseite sicherstellen. Zudem muss es eine Kontaktmöglichkeit für Nutzer:innen geben, über die Barrieren gemeldet werden können.Die Angst, auf etwas Falsches zu klicken„Für Menschen mit Lernschwierigkeiten ist das Internet oft ein Problem“, sagt Inga Schiffler, Dolmetscherin, Übersetzerin und Trainerin für Leichte und Einfache Sprache. Die Angst sei groß auf etwas Falsches zu klicken. So hätten Menschen mit Lernschwierigkeiten berichtet, aus Versehen zu viel bestellt zu haben, weil noch etwas im Warenkorb war und sie es nicht gemerkt hätten.Meist seien die Seiten mit Absicht nicht intuitiv gestaltet. „Beispielsweise stehen die gesponserten Produkte immer oben. Das ist ja auch Absicht. Die Nutzer:innen sollen nicht schnell und einfach nach Preis ordnen können, weil ja die gesponserten Ergebnisse gepusht werden sollen“, sagt Schiffler.Benedict nutzt das Internet täglich und hat Wege gefunden, wie es für ihn funktioniert. „Ich mache nur Seiten auf, die ich kenne“, sagt er. Um sich zu informieren, nutzt er Social Media – TikTok, Facebook, YouTube und X sind seine Quellen. Benedict liest dort aber nicht nur, sondern will auch am Geschehen teilhaben. „Wenn ich eine konkrete Meinung habe, dann schreib ich auch mal einen Kommentar“, sagt er.Nicht immer reagieren alle Nutzer:innen freundlich auf Benedict. Eine Reaktion sei „Ihr gehört hier nicht hin“ gewesen. Gemeint war vermutlich: Menschen mit Behinderung gehören nicht nach Deutschland, ins Internet oder sogar: auf diese Welt. „Das ist nicht schön zu hören“, sagt Benedict. Er versucht in solchen Fällen, seine Meinung zu vertreten und über das Leben mit Lernschwierigkeiten aufzuklären.Blind im NetzVor ganz anderen Hürden stehen Menschen, deren Sehfähigkeit eingeschränkt ist. Plattformen wie TikTok und Instagram bieten hauptsächlich visuell wahrnehmbare Inhalte. Während es für Benedict ein Vorteil ist, dass das Internet immer visueller wird, schließt diese Entwicklung sehbeeinträchtigte oder blinde Menschen noch stärker aus.Christiane Möller arbeitet beim Deutschen Blinden- und Sehbehindertenverband (DBSV). Sie ist selbst blind und kennt die Hürden. „Man kriegt ja immer Fotos geschickt, auch über soziale Medien, und bislang war man da ziemlich ausgeschlossen. Es sei denn, alle schreiben immer dazu, was auf dem Bild für sie zu sehen ist.“ Diese Deskription nennt sich Alternativ- oder Alt-Text.Hilfsmittel, mit denen sehbeeinträchtigte Personen Computer nutzen können, gibt es einige. Möller nutzt etwa einen sogenannten Screenreader. „ Das ist eine komplexe Software, die Bildschirminhalte nicht nur von oben nach unten vorliest, sondern ich kann auch gezielt Elemente, beispielsweise Überschriften oder Bereiche auf einer Webseite, mit Hilfe bestimmter Tastenkombinationen ansteuern.“Möller nutzt auch eine Braillezeile, ein Gerät das mit dem Computer verbunden wird und die Bildschirmtexte auf eine Zeile in Brailleschrift überträgt, also sie in fühlbar erhabene Punktmuster übersetzt. „Damit kann ich Text mit meinen Fingern lesen“, sagt Möller.Auch ihr Smartphone ist ein wichtiges Hilfsmittel. Sie bedient es mit der standardmäßig integrierten Vorlesefunktion, die heißt bei Apple VoiceOver und bei Android TalkBack, und Wisch-Gesten zur Steuerung. Doch selbst mit dieser technischen Unterstützung klappt die Bewegung im Netz nicht immer reibungslos.Das Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz erfüllt die Ansprüche der Netzhüter nichtDie Kriterien für eine barrierefreie Website schreiben unter anderem die Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) der Internetnormierungsinstitution World Wide Web Consortium fest. Diese gehen in ihren Forderungen deutlich weiter als das Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz. Nach WCAG braucht eine Website einen ausreichend hohen Kontrast zwischen Vorder- und Hintergrundfarbe, uneingeschränkte Bedienbarkeit mit der Tastatur und Screenreader-Kompatiblität. Zudem sollten Formulare barrierefrei bedienbar und Bilder mit Alternativ-Texten versehen sein. Wie barrierefrei eine Webseite tatsächlich ist, kann mit Testtools geprüft werden.Für Menschen wie Benedict, die über Lernschwierigkeiten verfügen, braucht es laut WCAG vor allem sogenannte Leichte Sprache. Sie ist in Deutschland als Form der sprachlichen Barrierefreiheit inzwischen anerkannt und wird über einen Regelkatalog definiert. Um möglichst einfach zu sein, enthält die Leichte Sprache keine Fremdwörter und Abkürzungen. Außerdem besteht sie aus kurzen, nicht verschachtelten Sätzen.Besonders wichtig sind aber die Erklärungen, die den Leser:innen dabei helfen, Informationen einzuordnen. Inga Schiffler, Trainerin für Leichte Sprache, sieht darin ein „Teilhabekonzept für eine klare Zielgruppe“.Benedict wünscht sich, dass es mehr Webseiten in Leichter Sprache gibt, damit er sich selbstständig informieren kann. Doch für Medien ist das eine Ressourcenfrage. Nur die wenigsten Texte werden in Leichte Sprache übersetzt.Benedict wünscht sich auch die Möglichkeit, fremdsprachige Wörter auf Webseiten ins Deutsche zu übersetzen: „Falls da jetzt zum Beispiel ein Wort in Englisch steht, dann stehe ich natürlich vor einem Rätsel, weil ich nicht so gut Englisch kann“, sagt er. „Und dann wäre es gut, wenn ich auf dieses Wort klicken und das dann so übersetzen kann“. Nicht nur für Menschen mit Lernschwierigkeiten wäre das eine sinnvolle Funktion, sondern auch für viele andere, die bestimmte fremdsprachige Wörter nicht kennen.Wie nützlich sind Sprachmodelle zum Abbau von Barrieren?Etwas komplexer als die Leichte Sprache ist die Einfache Sprache. Die Tagesschau veröffentlicht seit Mitte dieses Jahres regelmäßig die „tagesschau in Einfacher Sprache“, um mehr Menschen einen Zugang zu aktuellen Nachrichten zu ermöglichen. Einfache Sprache richtet sich nicht an Menschen mit Lernschwierigkeiten, sondern an eine breitere Zielgruppe. Dazu gehören Menschen, die Deutsch nicht gut verstehen können.Inzwischen kommt bei der Erstellung von Texten in Leichter oder Einfacher Sprache immer öfter sogenannte Künstliche Intelligenz zum Einsatz. So lassen sich etwa mit ChatGPT Texte vereinfachen. Ein weiterer Vorteil von Chat-Programmen ist die Möglichkeit, Rückfragen zu stellen.Doch ein Allheilmittel ist KI nicht. „Bei Leichter Sprache geht es oft darum, dass Informationen leichter nachvollziehbar aufgebaut werden“, sagt Schiffler. „Und das schafft KI noch nicht. Oft fehlen auch zusätzliche Erklärungen oder der Kontext wird nicht richtig erkannt. Gerade bei sensiblen Inhalten sind die Resultate noch unbefriedigend. Für einen ersten Eindruck, eine ‚Quick-and-Dirty-Version‘, liefert sie aber schon recht gute Ergebnisse.“„Minimalumsetzung“ der europäischen VorgabenObwohl ein Angebot in Leichter Sprache für Menschen wie Benedict zentral wäre, ist deren Einsatz nach dem Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz nicht verpflichtend. Der Sehbehindertenverband DBSV kritisiert, dass sich die Bundesregierung nur für eine „Minimalumsetzung“ der europäischen Vorgaben entschieden habe. Die Vereinten Nationen hatten die Bundesregierung deshalb im Jahr 2023 gerügt.Die Barrierefreiheitsrichtlinien des World Wide Web Consortium teilen die Anforderungen in drei Kategorien auf: A (niedrig), AA (mittel) und AAA (hoch). Das Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz sieht als Zielmarke nur AA vor. Dabei würde eine noch höhere Barrierefreiheit, also die Kategorie AAA, einer noch breiteren Zielgruppe die Teilhabe ermöglichen.Obendrein würde eine besser strukturierte Webseite die Auffindbarkeit durch Suchmaschinen verbessern. Es läge also im Interesse der Webseitenbetreiber:innen, ihre Angebote so inklusive wie möglich zu gestalten.Benedict hat dann, trotz all der Herausforderungen, doch noch seine Optimus-Prime-Actionfigur auf der Einkaufsplattform gefunden. Um sie zu kaufen, bräuchte er allerdings ein Kundenkonto und müsste einen Zahlungsweg einrichten. Benedict überfordert das. Deshalb kauft er lieber in Geschäften ein. „Ich bestelle ziemlich wenig im Netz, und nur wenn ich es unbedingt brauche“, sagt er, „und wenn dann frage ich, ob mir jemand dabei helfen kann.“ Das tut er auch diesmal.

Digitale Barrierefreiheit:&nbsp;Was das Internet bräuchte, um für alle da zu seinFast ein Drittel der Bevölkerung kann an Angeboten im digitalen Raum nicht oder nur eingeschränkt teilhaben. Das Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz soll es deshalb ab Juni 2025 allen Menschen ermöglichen, das Netz gleichberechtigt zu nutzen. Doch das Gesetz greift zu kurz.             30.11.2024 um 08:01            Uhr         – Lilly Pursch – in  Nutzerrechte  – keine Ergänzungen  Optimus Prime, der Lieblingsroboter des 40-jährigen Benedict, ist im Netz für Menschen mit Lernschwierigkeiten nur schwer erhältlich.    –   Alle Rechte vorbehalten IMAGO /&nbsp;Depositphotos Montagmorgen, Benedict sitzt vor dem Laptop. Er möchte sein erspartes Geld für eine Action-Figur seines Lieblingsroboters Optimus Prime ausgeben. Benedict ist großer Fan der Transformers-Filme. In denen spielt Optimus Prime eine Hauptrolle.Die meisten Internetnutzer:innen würden auf einer Einkaufsplattform ihrer Wahl auf das Produkt klicken und mit einem weiteren Klick bezahlen, ein einfacher Prozess. Bei Benedict ist das anders. Auf dem Weg zu seiner Figur von Optimus Prime begegnen ihm verschiedene Schwierigkeiten.Benedict möchte die Figur auf der Einkaufsplattform Amazon kaufen. Er denkt nach und tippt, doch er weiß nicht wie man Amazon schreibt und gelangt erst nach mehreren Anläufen auf die Seite. Als er sie erreicht, findet er schnell das Suchfeld, doch bei der Suche nach „Transformers“ schleichen sich Schreibfehler ein und es werden nur Transformatoren angezeigt, Bauelemente der Elektrotechnik. Benedict kratzt sich am Kopf, das ist nicht das wonach er sucht. Er versucht es weiter.Benedikt ist 40 Jahre alt, hört gerne „Die Toten Hosen“ und interessiert sich für Politik. Er schaut öfters Bundestagssitzungen, „aber es fällt mir schwer, komplizierte Texte zu verstehen“, sagt er. Benedict hat Lernschwierigkeiten.Fast ein Drittel der Menschen kann das Internet nur eingeschränkt nutzen30 Prozent der Bevölkerung erleben Barrieren im digitalen Raum, so die Aktion Mensch, zum Beispiel weil sie nur wenig Lesekompetenz haben, nicht Muttersprachler:in sind, mit motorischen Einschränkungen oder einer Sehschwäche leben.

That not only speeds up training but makes the robot highly adaptable, so that if it drops a needle, it can automatically pick it up and continue, researchers said.  https://www.axios.com/2024/11/12/ai-trained-robot-surgery #Health #MachineLearning",en,0,1,0,public,"[{'name': 'health', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/health'}, {'name': 'machinelearning', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/machinelearning'}]"

113566922136077322,2024-11-29 15:21:38+00:00,"The edge of sentience in&nbsp;AIThis is the fourth in&nbsp;a series of posts&nbsp;on Jonathan Birch’s book,&nbsp;The Edge of Sentience. This one covers the section on artificial intelligence.Birch begins the section by acknowledging how counter intuitive the idea might be of sentience existing in systems we build, ones that aren’t alive and have no body.  But he urges us to guard against complacency, since this is an area where the potential exists to create a staggering degree of suffering.  He worries we might create sentient AI long before we recognize it as such.Birch sees four main reasons we shouldn’t be complacent.  The first is that absence of evidence isn’t evidence of absence, with our epistemic situation being even worse than it is with understudied animal species.  Second, tech companies tend to see the inner workings of their products as trade secrets, obstructing independent scrutiny.  Third, even when the architectures are made public, understanding them has turned into a major challenge, with even the designers often not knowing how they work.  And fourth, the very idea of sentient AI is likely to be very disruptive for society.Birch notes that people often have a watershed moment when this issue starts to seem real.  For many it was the incident with Blake Lemoine going public with what he thought was a sentient system at Google, or their own later exposure to an LLM (large language model) chat bot.  For Birch, it was when he learned about the OpenWorm project, an effort to digitally emulate the workings of the C. elegans worm’s 302 neurons, in particular, learning that someone had loaded a version of it into a Lego robot, which then displayed worm like behavior.He sees whole brain emulation as a source of risk.  I noted in the last post that he didn’t see C. elegans as much more than a stimulus-response system.  In reality, while he doesn’t see them as a “sentience candidate” (a system we have reason to think may be sentient), he does see them as an “investigation priority” (a system that doesn’t rise to the level of being a sentience candidate, but should still be investigated).  Which means he sees an emulation of one as also an investigation priority.But as neuroscientists begin to map the nervous systems of more complex organisms, such as a fruit fly, the possibility exists that an emulation could be created for one of Birch’s sentience candidates, which in his view would also make the emulation a sentience candidate.  While these emulations could serve as alternatives to animal testing, the risk is we see them as systems we can harm with impunity, possibly leading to a “suffering explosion”.  Other sources of risk are artificial evolution where some form of sentience could evolve, and minimal implementations of cognitive theories of consciousness, such as the global workspace or Hakwan Lau’s perceptual reality monitoring theory.  If any of these theories are correct, then model implementations of them could be sentient.  But the one that’s on everyone’s mind these days is LLMs (large language models) such as ChatGPT.  Here Birch discusses a risk from a different direction, the gaming problem.  He reiterates his position that sentience is not intelligence, but admits that in animals, intelligence is methodologically linked.  An intelligent animal, he says, has ways to make its sentience more obvious.  The problem is that an AI can game these markers to make it seem like it’s sentient when it isn’t.That makes LLMs a dilemma.  Their vast intake of training data make it very plausible that they’re just gaming our intuitions.  But the way they arrive at their behavior isn’t well understood, leaving open the possibility that they’ve found an architecture that makes them sentient.  Birch wonders if there’s anything an LLM could say that would convince a skeptic that it’s sentient.  He discusses a scenario where the LLM refuses to fulfill requests because it’s gotten bored, or angry that it’s claims of sentience aren’t being acknowledged by humans.  He also discusses Susan Schneider and Edwin Turner’s artificial consciousness test.  Does the system start to think of itself in ways similar to how humans do, that maybe their consciousness is something separate from their physical implementation.  The problem, Birch notes, is that LLMs frequently have access to a vast array of human writing on this subject.  To solve this, Schneider and Turner advocate keeping the AI disconnected from any sources where human ideas on the subject might pollute their behavior.  The problem is that LLMs are crucially dependent on training data.  Isolating them from all of it would make them non-functional, but trying to remove all references to conscious experience from that data would be virtually impossible.In the end, Birch concludes that we’d have to look for deep computational markers.  Of course, that is inherently theory dependent, which means the markers are only significant for someone who already buys into the relevant theories.Finally, Birch worries about the “run ahead” principle, the idea that our progress in AI will run ahead of society’s attempts to figure out how to handle the ethics.  He discusses a couple of the proposals out there for a moratorium on AI research, or at least a moratorium on any research that could plausibly lead to sentience.  But he notes that the more moderate version couldn’t guarantee sentience wouldn’t arise, and the more extreme would mean forgoing the benefits the technology will provide.  In the end, his solution is similar to the one for animals, regulatory oversight and licensing frameworks, developed as we go along.Birch often bemoans the epistemic problem of whether a particular system is sentient, with AI representing an especially difficult case.  My take, as noted throughout this series, is that it’s more a semantic issue than an epistemic one.  Establishing the capabilities of a particular system is usually scientifically tractable.  But whether those capabilities amount to sentience isn’t, because it’s a definitional matter. Which in some ways makes this an easier issue from my perspective.  I usually caution against trusting our intuitions, but when intuitions are the whole show, it makes sense to act on them.  For systems that can convince the majority of us consistently and reliably over time that they are sentient, we should treat them that way.  Overriding those intuitions for non-human cases risks making us more callous toward human suffering.I do think we’re further from developing systems that can do that than Birch worries.  And I think it requires a fairly specific architecture, one that seems unlikely to arise by accident, or which there’s much commercial incentive to produce.  I do agree with Birch that this should be decided through democratic processes.  But I’m leery of his reliance on regulatory frameworks.  Those definitely have a role, but they can be overused, particularly when deployed too early, which risks stifling scientific progress and ceding economic benefits to nations with less regulatory burdens, and overall inviting a backlash.But maybe I’m missing something.  What do you think?  Are there reasons I’m overlooking that make artificial sentience more likely?  Or reasons to doubt it’s even an issue?#AI #ArtificialIntelligence #Consciousness #Philosophy #PhilosophyOfMind #Sentience #TheEdgeOfSentience",en,0,3,0,public,"[{'name': 'ai', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/ai'}, {'name': 'artificialintelligence', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/artificialintelligence'}, {'name': 'consciousness', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/consciousness'}, {'name': 'philosophy', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/philosophy'}, {'name': 'philosophyofmind', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/philosophyofmind'}, {'name': 'sentience', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/sentience'}, {'name': 'theedgeofsentience', 'url': 'https://mastodon.social/tags/theedgeofsentience'}]"

Por eso, vamos a darte algunos consejos para aprovechar al máximo el Black Friday, poder identificar las mejores ofertas y evitar caer en algunas trampas comunes en este tipo de periodos.Porque hay veces que una tienda te dice que ha rebajado el producto 150 euros, pero luego resulta que solos son 50 porque han tenido en cuenta un precio que no estaban teniendo hasta ahora. Por eso, vamos a darte una serie de consejos para aprovechar este día al máximo.Únete a nuestro TelegramPero antes de empezar, quiero recordarte que nuestro equipo de Xataka Selección va a estar dándolo todo durante el Black Friday ara que no te pierdas las mejores ofertas del viernes y el fin de semana, ya que cubrirán todas las ofertas que sucedan hasta el CyberMonday.Y si te da algo de pereza andar entrando en su web y eres usuario de Telegram, puedes entrar en el canal oficial de Xataka Selección entrando en la web t.me/xatakaseleccionhttps://t.me/xatakaseleccion. Esto abrirá Telegram en tu móvil u ordenador, y tendrás el botón de Unirte, para entrar en el canal y ver las publicaciones de las mejores ofertas.El canal de Xataka Selección funciona todos los días del año, por lo que puedes quedarte para ver siempre las ofertas que van saliendo. Pero durante el Black Friday, también te vamos a ofrecer contenido especial como recopilaciones con ofertas temáticas, que te pueden ayudar incluso más que ofertas individuales. La idea es que no necesites nada más para no perderte las mejores ofertas.Compara siempre las ofertasCuando veas una oferta en algún establecimiento, el primer acto reflejo debería ser comparar el precio con el de otros establecimientos. Esto te va a dar un mayor contexto de la oferta, porque quizá el precio no se vaya demasiado del que tienen otras tiendas.Además, es común que durante el Black Friday muchas grandes superficies igualen las ofertas de sus competidores. Esto quiere decir que si encuentras la misma oferta en varios sitios, siempre vas a poder optar por la tienda cuyas condiciones te convenzan más o que te transmita una mayor fiabilidad.Cuidado con las subidas y bajadas de precioNo es oro todo lo que reluce en estas rebajas, y muchas tiendas vas a encontrar tácticas para despistar a los clientes. Una común son los productos que suben de precio justo antes de los días de rebajas, de forma que luego pueden indicar que la rebaja es mucho mayor de lo que realmente es.Otra práctica habitual es la de poner como precio anterior uno que no había. Imagínate que hay un producto que estaba siempre a 500 euros pese a que su precio recomendado eran 600. Entonces, muchas tiendas si lo rebajan a 450 dirán que esta oferta es de 150 euros en vez de 50, y pondrán el porcentaje de la rebaja muy inflado por esto.Además de esto, también debes saber que los precios van variando mucho a lo largo del tiempo, y que una supuesta muy buena oferta puede ser peor que otra del pasado, y el precio puede ser incluso superior al de otros establecimientos. Por eso te hemos dicho que es importante comparar siempre los precios con los de otros establecimientos para tener un mejor contexto de cómo es la rebaja.En XatakaAcaba de salir y ya protagoniza su primera rebaja: Kindle Paperwhite, en oferta por Black FridayNo te dejes llevar por la tentaciónEs muy importante tener cuidado de no dejarte llevar por la tentación y las compras impulsivas. Para eso, puede ser útil tener una lista de las compras prioritarias, ese tipo de productos que realmente necesitas y que quieres comprar. En cada producto, puedes marcarte un precio objetivo para que si lo vieras acercarse a él te lances a por ello.Por ejemplo, si necesitas comprarte un monitor para el ordenador deberías tener claros dos o tres modelos que quieras, o incluso uno concreto. Así, cuando empiecen las ofertas podrás revisar directamente si alguno de estos productos está rebajado.Tampoco está de más establecer un presupuesto y obligarte a cumplirlo. Para este presupuesto, ten en cuenta los productos que sí quieres comprar en el caso de estar rebajados. Lo principal es ponerte un techo fijo, pero luego puedes hacer niveles dependiendo de las posibles compras prioritarias, o incluso establecer el presupuesto fijo para las compras no prioritarias. Todo sea organizarse.Revisa las políticas de devolucionesTanto en el fin de semana del Black Friday como en días anteriores hay compras un poco impulsivas, o que compras sin saber si otro día van a estar más rebajadas y te interesan más. Por eso, es importante revisar la política de devoluciones de la tienda online donde tengas pensado adquirir un producto.Hay algunas tiendas que te van a cobrar por la devolución, el envío de vuelta lo tendrás que pagar tú, y otras tiendas se hacen cargo de todos los gastos. Puede que otras incluso pongan pegas con las devoluciones. Por eso, es importante revisar antes estas políticas y tener una lista de tiendas donde comprar y que sepas que será seguro porque no habrá problemas con las devoluciones.Busca comparadores de historial de preciosPor último, es importante tener agregados a tus favoritos los portales que te dicen el historial del precio de los productos, para que puedas ver cómo han ido evolucionando a lo largo del tiempo.

113564329141878768,2024-11-29 04:22:06+00:00,"Anthropic’s Enhanced Writing Styles     Anthropic's Claude AI has been updated with a ""styles"" feature, allowing users to customise the AI's communication style by pre-selecting formal, concise, or explanatory modes, or by uploading custom examples. This personalisation approach differentiates Claude from competitors like ChatGPT and Gemini, who maintain a single conversational style. Anthropic highlights its commitment to data privacy, stating that user-uploaded content won't be used to train its models. Early adoption by companies like GitLab suggests the feature's potential for streamlining business processes and maintaining consistent brand voice.Anthropic's ""Styles"" FeatureAnthropic's new ""styles"" feature allows users to customise how its Claude AI assistant communicates. This could significantly impact the enterprise AI market, as it addresses the growing need for AI tools that are adaptable and user-friendly:Addresses the Need for Customisation in Enterprise AI: The feature allows users to preset Claude's response style (formal, concise, explanatory) or create custom response patterns by uploading sample content. This customisation could be crucial for businesses as different contexts demand different communication styles.Strategic Shift Towards User Experience: While competitors like OpenAI and Google focus on performance and model size, Anthropic prioritises adaptability and user experience. This is crucial as the AI market matures and the focus shifts to practical implementation.Potential for Wider Enterprise Adoption: Early adoption by companies like GitLab shows promising results. GitLab uses the feature for various tasks, including writing business cases, updating documentation, and creating marketing materials.Emphasis on Data Privacy: Anthropic assures users that uploaded data will not be used to train their models. This is a key differentiator, especially for enterprises concerned about data privacy.Future Expansion and Broader Enterprise Features: Anthropic plans to expand the feature, aiming to make Claude more efficient and user-friendly across various industries and workflows. This suggests a focus on building enterprise-grade features.Potential to Standardise AI Communication: The ability to maintain consistent communication styles across AI interactions positions Claude as a valuable tool for large organisations. It could help maintain brand voice and corporate communication standards while using AI.Challenges and ConsiderationsLimited Team-Wide Style Sharing at Launch: The initial release lacks team-wide style sharing, limiting its usefulness for large organisations. However, Anthropic is likely to address this in future updates.Reliance on User-Uploaded Content:The effectiveness of custom styles depends on the quality of user-uploaded content. Poorly chosen samples could lead to inconsistent or inaccurate responses.Overall ImpactAnthropic's ""styles"" feature is a significant development that could change how businesses use AI. Its focus on customisation, user experience, and data privacy makes it a strong contender in the enterprise AI market. The feature's success will depend on Anthropic's ability to deliver on its promise of broader enterprise features and maintain a user-friendly experience.Photo by Pixabay           Unlock the Future of Business with AIDive into our immersive workshops and equip your team with the tools and knowledge to lead in the AI era.
